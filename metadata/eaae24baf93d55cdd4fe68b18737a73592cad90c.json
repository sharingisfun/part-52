The Doctor finds a way to communicate with the creature, which explains that there has been such a protracted silence from him communicating with his race, that they have sent a neutron star towards Chloris to destroy it. The Doctor has to join forces with the creature to save the planet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaae24baf93d55cdd4fe68b18737a73592cad90c","amp;dn":"Dr+Who+-+S17E03+-+P2+-+The+Creature+from+the+Pit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaae24baf93d55cdd4fe68b18737a73592cad90c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,174,36,186,249,61,85,205,212,254,104,177,135,55,167,53,146,202,217,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
