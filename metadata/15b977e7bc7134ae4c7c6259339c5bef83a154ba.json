It is presented here as a musical, rather than\n\nas an operetta, which makes it suitable for a wider audience. Dirch\n\nPasser (as Leopold) is at his best here, and the other actors are\n\nwell fitted to their roles, especially Ove SprogÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸e as Leopold\\\\\\&amp;#039;s rival,\n\nSigismund. There is none of the vulgarity that can be found in\n\nsome of Passer\\\\\\&amp;#039;s later films, only light-hearted humour and\n\nromance. Oh, and the landscape is breathtaking. \n\n\n\n\nEn klassisk film med alle de gode gamle danske stjerner i fuld dvd kvalitet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b977e7bc7134ae4c7c6259339c5bef83a154ba","amp;dn":"Sommer+i+Tyrol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b977e7bc7134ae4c7c6259339c5bef83a154ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,185,119,231,188,113,52,174,76,124,98,89,51,156,91,239,131,161,84,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
