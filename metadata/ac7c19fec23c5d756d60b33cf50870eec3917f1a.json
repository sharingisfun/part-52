Length : 90min                      \n\n\n In the unsanctioned, underground, and unhinged world of extreme Ping-Pong,   \n the competition is brutal and the stakes are deadly. Now, this outrageous    \n new comedy serves up this secret world for the first time on-screen.         \n Down-and-out former professional Ping-Pong phenom Randy Daytona (Dan         \n Fogler) is sucked into this maelstrom when FBI Agent Rodriguez (George       \n Lopez) recruits him for a secret mission. Randy is determined to bounce      \n back and recapture his former glory, and to smoke out his father&amp;#039;s (Robert   \n Patrick) killer - one of the FBI&amp;#039;s Most Wanted, arch-fiend Feng              \n (Christopher Walken). But, after two decades out of the game, Randy can&amp;#039;t    \n turn his life around and avenge his father&amp;#039;s murder without a team of his    \n own. He calls upon the spiritual guidance of blind Ping-Pong sage and        \n restaurateur Wong (James Hong), and the training expertise of Master Wong&amp;#039;s  \n wildly sexy niece Maggie (Maggie Q), both of whom also have a dark history   \n with Feng. All roads lead to Feng&amp;#039;s mysterious jungle compound and the most  \n unique Ping-Pong tournaments ever staged. There, Randy faces such            \n formidable players as his long-ago Olympics opponent, the still-vicious      \n Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon). Can Randy keep his eye on the ball? Will   \n he achieve the redemption he craves while wielding a paddle? Is his          \n backhand strong enough to triumph over rampant wickedness?                   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac7c19fec23c5d756d60b33cf50870eec3917f1a","amp;dn":"Balls+Of+Fury.WS.2007.XviD.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac7c19fec23c5d756d60b33cf50870eec3917f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,124,25,254,194,60,93,117,109,96,179,60,245,8,112,238,195,145,127,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
