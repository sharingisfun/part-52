An extra line from the deleted scenes was added to make\n      it appear that Frank Butterman won&amp;#039;t let Angel accuse Skinner of\n      anything, let alone act on it. Angel just goes back to the hotel.\n    * Extended fence jump scene.\n    * Also cut some unfunny jokes &amp; unnecessary lines.\n    * Some scenes were trimmed.\n    * Credits heavily edited, &quot;Solid Gold Easy Action&quot; song removed.\n\n\nYour intention for this fanedit: HOT FUZZ was too long. So I felt I should cut it down to a more leaner, somewhat faster-paced and funner film.\nHardware and software information:\n\n\n    * DVDx\n    * K-Lite Codec Pack\n    * Sony Vegas 7\n\n\nDVD specifications:\n\n\n    * Video: PAL\n    * Audio: Dolby 5.1, DTS 5.1, Stereo 2.0\n    * Mostly Animated Menus\n    * Scene Selection\n    * Easter Egg\n    * Private Joke\n\n\nTime needed for the edition: 4 weeks ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07feb81092bfc3329eca862f4f21db048b98e43e","amp;dn":"VIDEO_TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07feb81092bfc3329eca862f4f21db048b98e43e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,254,184,16,146,191,195,50,158,202,134,47,79,33,219,4,139,152,228,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
