It was totally unexpected then that Dog In The Sand was home to some of the best material that Frank Black / Black Francis / Charles Thompson had written since Doolittle, indeed some of the songs here are better than material on the last two pixies albums. Chief among these is &quot;Blast Off&quot;, a song which seems to pay tribute in equal parts to David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. In addition to this epic first track, &quot;Robert Onion&quot;, &quot;Bullet&quot; and &quot;Hermaphroditos&quot; are as strong as anything on Bossanova or Trompe le monde.\n\n1\tBlast Off\t\n2\tI&amp;#039;ve Seen Your Picture\t\n3\tSt. Francis Dam Disaster\t\n4\tRobert Onion\t\n5\tStupid Me\t\n6\tBullet\t\n7\tThe Swimmer\t\n8\tHermaphroditos Is My Name\t\n9\tI&amp;#039;ll Be Blue\t\n10\tLlano Del Rio\t\n11\tIf It Takes All Night\t\n12\tDog in the Sand\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d304fbe2f24d7fefa1f5a9c86ce989730867285","amp;dn":"2001+-+Dog+In+The+Sand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d304fbe2f24d7fefa1f5a9c86ce989730867285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,48,79,190,47,36,215,254,250,31,90,156,134,206,152,151,48,134,114,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
