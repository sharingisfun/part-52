The next version of Windows Mobile Software includes Windows Media Player 10 Mobile, a great multimedia experience that will make it easy to transfer songs, videos, and pictures from your PC to your device.  Plus, the new platform offers more ways for developers, mobile operators, and OEMs to innovate.\n\nNote:\n\nThis is a repackage of the original leaked ROM entitled Windows_Mobile_5_SMT5600_SmartphoneC500_Magneto-_Typhoon_By_Mikey_Goldman.  WM2005 compatible file and task manager was created by Zone-MR of www.spv-developers.com (see here: http://www.spv-developers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=282) and all credit for these files goes to these two people.  I have hex edited the ROM to disable devauth.exe as suggested on xda-developers.com (credit to those guys there too).\n\nIncluded:\n\n2*15mb RAR\nRom file\nTask Manager\nFile Manager\nUSB Modem driver\nBootloader v.1.01.0109","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ea582fa5c13d7d822e27ed8334ed44d1ab1a60","amp;dn":"Windows.Mobile.5.ROM.Pack.For.HTC.Typhoon.C500.SMT5600","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ea582fa5c13d7d822e27ed8334ed44d1ab1a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,234,88,47,165,193,61,125,130,46,39,237,131,52,237,68,209,171,26,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
