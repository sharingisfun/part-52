Adding insult to injury, Todd must travel to India to train his new replacement. As he navigates through the chaos of Bombay and an office paralyzed by constant cultural misunderstandings, Todd yearns to return to the comforts of home. But it is through his team of Indian call center workers, including his motivated replacement, Puro, and the opinionated Asha (Ayesha Dharker), that Todd realizes that he too has a lot to learn not only about India and America, but about himself. He soon discovers that being outsourced may be the best thing that ever happened to him.\n\nSource:   Retail DvD\nVideo:     640 x 352\n               Video: 768 MB (70.59%)\nTime:      1:38:21\nFrames:  147,501\nkbps:      1092\nAudio:     0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\n              48000Hz  448 kb/s tot , 6 chnls (3/2 .1) \n               Audio: 315 MB (28.94%)\nFormat:   DivX Style &quot;packed bitstream&quot; AVI\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41461d74999239c892f14196096a6eaa7bc6accc","amp;dn":"Outsourced+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41461d74999239c892f14196096a6eaa7bc6accc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,70,29,116,153,146,57,200,146,241,65,150,9,106,110,170,123,198,172,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
