Eventually the inevitable happened, when what should have been a routine case brought her into conflict with the corruption within her own police force. It also confronted her with the realities of voodoo, when her lover was transformed into a zombie, and sent to kill her.\n\nEnraged, Catherine gave up the force and, using a lot of high-caliber weapons, expressed her disapproval of those responsible for wrecking her life. They ended up dead, and she ended up on the FBI Most Wanted list. Now using the alias Bad Kitty, and accompanied by her black cat, Lucky, she continues to confront the supernatural, and tries to survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cac4915b84f96b54535bc1de641fa93de9d90b0","amp;dn":"Bad+Kitty+%28Chaos+comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cac4915b84f96b54535bc1de641fa93de9d90b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,172,73,21,184,79,150,181,69,53,188,29,230,65,250,147,222,157,144,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
