It&amp;#039;s VERY true to the original book and is almost perfect. Any King Arthur/Camelot fan or Marion Zimmer Bradley fan, or even someone who generally doesn&amp;#039;t like fantasy, will enjoy this. I did not originally upload this torrent, it was uploaded by someone else and has very few seeders since the original upload at a popular site that is now closed (we all know which one, I&amp;#039;m sure) and it&amp;#039;s the only place I know of that has a torrent of this. I had to share! I&amp;#039;ve kept this on my computer for at least a year and a half now, that&amp;#039;s how great this movie is. It&amp;#039;s in two parts, each about an hour and a half long, and is fairly good quality. Not sure if it&amp;#039;s a DVD rip or what, though. My share ratio on this is over 100, so I&amp;#039;ve been seeding it for quite a while :) Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a86e5be2ae7856f9330c09255244c693ef774c49","amp;dn":"The+Mists+of+Avalon+%28based+on+the+book+by+Marion+Zimmer+Bradley%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a86e5be2ae7856f9330c09255244c693ef774c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,110,91,226,174,120,86,249,51,12,9,37,82,68,198,147,239,119,76,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
