With Plunkett&amp;#039;s criminal know-how and Macleane&amp;#039;s social connections, they team up to be soon known as &quot;The Gentlemen Highwaymen&quot;. But when one day these gentlemen hold up Lord Chief Justice Gibson&amp;#039;s coach, Macleane instantly falls in love with his beautiful and cunning niece, Lady Rebecca Gibson. Unfortunately, Thief Taker General Chance, who also is quite fond of Rebecca, is getting closer and closer to getting both: The Gentlemen Highwaymen and Rebecca, who, needless to tell, don&amp;#039;t want to get any closer to him. But Plunkett still has a thing to sort out with Chance, and his impulsiveness gets all of them in a little trouble.

He soon hooks up with disgraced soldier Captain Macleane (Johnny Lee Miller) to continue robbing the rich to fund his move to America. Things get a little bit muddled for them when Macleane falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) and Chance comes closer and closer to nailing them.
