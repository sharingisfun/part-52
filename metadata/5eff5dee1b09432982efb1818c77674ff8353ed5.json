The TV Shows category has a lot of traffic and the torrents seem to get forgotten. There are easily at least twice the number of downloaders in this category and I have no intention of seeding these large uploads for a long time. AND the files are DVD files so why the hell put them in the tv shows category where 99% are avi&amp;#039;s in the first place?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eff5dee1b09432982efb1818c77674ff8353ed5","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+TNG+Season+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eff5dee1b09432982efb1818c77674ff8353ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,255,93,238,27,9,67,41,130,239,177,129,140,119,103,79,248,53,62,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
