His range and magic are both 90+, and he uses barrage as well and launches impressive magic shortbow specs. I should add that this video is either early &amp;#039;07, if not late &amp;#039;06 -- so don&amp;#039;t expect any fancy weapons/loot.\n\nThe kills/loot are not amazing, but in my opinion this is one of the last tastefully edited Runescape pk videos.\n\nSeeded by Doodlepieguy.
