The music itself, especially in performances of such warmth and brilliance as these, reveals no trace of the waning of mental or physical powers that Haydn himself lamented; where there are shadows, they are cast not by external circumstance but by the composer&amp;#039;s vivid response to the words of the Ordinary. Although the rich and colourful orchestration justifies the familiar name of the &amp;#039;Wind-band Mass&amp;#039;, the &amp;#039;Creation&amp;#039; Mass too rejoices in Haydn&amp;#039;s imaginative scoring. One of the pleasures of Gardiner&amp;#039;s performances is that the orchestral detail is so clearly and affectionately projected, without the listener ever feeling that attention is being distracted from the grand design.\n\nEAC ----&gt; MP3 LAME ENCODER @ 320 kbps vbr\n\nrejoyce .... greatly .... &amp; SHARE ^^ thanks\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:999cb5daecc41e917006f68cf105bd22fe5608ef","amp;dn":"Haydn+%5C%22missa+in+angustiis%5C%22+%26+%5C%22Schopfungsmes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"999cb5daecc41e917006f68cf105bd22fe5608ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,156,181,218,236,196,30,145,112,6,246,140,241,5,189,34,254,86,8,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
