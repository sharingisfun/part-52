They want him out, so they hire Paula, an \\&quot;interventionist,\\&quot; who has a formula in these cases: chance encounter, get him to ask her out, involve him in a trauma, meet his friends and get their nod, delay sex, have him teach her something, then launch him. It\\&amp;#039;s worked up to now, but this gets complicated when Tripp thinks she\\&amp;#039;s getting too serious and one of his pals is attracted to Paula\\&amp;#039;s deadpan, semi-alcoholic roommate, who\\&amp;#039;s plagued by a mockingbird. Too many secrets may scrub the launch, and what if Paula really likes him? Who can intervene then?\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427229/\n\nDon\\&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 2.38 GB\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Failure To Launch.mkv\nDate: 31/01/2008 11:04:55\nSize: 2,557,640,360 bytes (2439.156 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:36:20 (5779.658 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 31/01/2008 16:02:42 UTC\nNumber of streams: 5\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {English Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 4: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {Spanish Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {French Subtitles}\nAudio streams: 1\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (\\&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall\\&amp;#039;) built on Dec 31 2007 20:13:50\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 32\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nFrame aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels (container): 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nMode: 3 front, 2 rear, 1 LFE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71b7b05786b9b774e93b5a1ff2132d4bf58f4c4","amp;dn":"Failure+To+Launch+HD+720p+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71b7b05786b9b774e93b5a1ff2132d4bf58f4c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,27,123,5,120,107,155,119,78,147,181,161,255,33,50,212,191,88,244,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
