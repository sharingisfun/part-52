Length : 110min                   \n\n\n When a terrorist bomb detonates inside a Western housing compound in         \n Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, an international incident is ignited. While diplomats  \n slowly debate equations of territorialism, FBI Special Agent Ronald Fleury   \n quickly assembles an elite team and negotiates a secret five-day trip into   \n Saudi Arabia to locate the madman behind the bombing. Upon landing in the    \n desert kingdom, however, Fleury and his team discover Saudi authorities      \n suspicious and unwelcoming of American interlopers into what they consider   \n a local matter. Hamstrung by protocol-and with the clock ticking on their    \n five days-the FBI agents find their expertise worthless without the trust    \n of their Saudi counterparts, who want to locate the terrorist in their       \n homeland on their own terms. Fleury&amp;#039;s crew finds a like-minded partner in    \n Saudi Colonel Al-Ghazi, who helps them navigate royal politics and unlock    \n the secrets of the crime scene and the workings of an extremist cell bent    \n on further destruction. With these unlikely allies sharing a                            \n propulsive commitment to crack the case, the team led to the\n killer&amp;#039;s front door in a blistering do or-die confrontation.\n Now in a fight for their own lives, strangers united by one mission won&amp;#039;t                             \n stop until justice is found in The Kingdom.                                  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dedbbb6916ed919cd3829b074702ca06e4e1885","amp;dn":"The+Kingdom.WS.2007.XviD.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dedbbb6916ed919cd3829b074702ca06e4e1885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,237,187,182,145,110,217,25,205,56,41,176,116,112,44,160,110,78,24,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
