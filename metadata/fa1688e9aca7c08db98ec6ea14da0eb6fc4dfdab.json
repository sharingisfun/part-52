It's the first time this story is told in a motion Picture, included in the film are pioneer dance music DJs and producers, &quot;founding fathers&quot;, its center being Larry Levan, as well as high-profile DJs of today. Most film documents of this historical movement have fallen short of its true story and impact to the world, providing us with a glossed over account of the time. Opting for a more personal and candid approach, MAESTRO shows the true history of the people through a realistic creative aesthetic. Tracing the underground's dance origin, MAESTRO brings out a real understanding of this intense lifestyle, and the lives they lived and died for. It is far from mere nostalgia, this film is like the music and experiences it chronicles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa1688e9aca7c08db98ec6ea14da0eb6fc4dfdab","amp;dn":"Maestro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa1688e9aca7c08db98ec6ea14da0eb6fc4dfdab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,22,136,233,172,167,192,141,185,142,198,234,20,218,14,182,252,77,253,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
