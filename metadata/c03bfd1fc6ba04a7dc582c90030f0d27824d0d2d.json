But when mixed with other substances, such as benzodiazopenes, the treatment can be as harmful as the heroin itself. METHADONIA exposes the problems of treating heroin addiction with legal methadone.\n\nMETHADONIA is the borderland between high and straight, where recovering heroin addicts on methadone &quot;maintenance&quot; exist. Passing the time on benzos and other prescription drugs that enhance the methadone, addicts find themselves in Methadonia for years, or decades. Selected for the prestigious New York Film Festival and featured on HBO, this unflinching, intimate film reveals the culture of addiction through the eyes and lives of men and women stuck in Methadonia, holding on to the hope they will wake up one morning and not think about getting high.\nBlack Tar Heroin \nAn extraordinary look at two years in the lives of five young heroin addicts, Black Tar Heroin offers a rare and intimate portrait of how heroin devastates young lives. The film chronicles the daily lives of Jake, Jessica, Tracey, Oreo and Alice, three young women and two young men, ages 18 to 25, as they face the ever-present perils of hard core drug addiction--crime, prostitution, rape, incarceration, AIDS, overdoses and death.\nThe film shows the brutality and degradation of the drug life, but also depicts the addicts pain and raw yearning -- to get clean, to hold relationships together, to re-connect with their families, to get their lives back.\nAcademy Award-winning filmmaker Steven Okazaki, with associate producer and sound recordist Jason Cohen, spent more than two years in San Francisco's drug underworld, recording the stories of the city's young addicts. Using mostly hand-held camerawork, often working without electricity -- lighting with camping lanterns, flashlights and candles -- they unflinchingly capture the harsh realities as well as the human side of the addicts' desperate world.\n===========================================================\nHIGH ON CRACK STREET \n\nIn blue-collar Lowell, Massachusetts, where disappearing businesses and jobs have produced high unemployment, some residents have turned to crack for relief - only to see their dreams of a better life go up in smoke. A Harrowing documentary chronicling 18 months in the lives of three addicts. \n\nUncompromising and revealing, HIGH ON CRACK STREET: LOST LIVES IN LOWELL takes an up-close look at the lives of three crackhouse friends whose addiction has let them to crime and despair. \n\nFor HIGH ON CRACK STREET, documentarians Jon Alpert and Mary Ann DeLeo teamed up with Lowell resident and former drug addict Rich Farrell, who was able to obtain remarkable access to the townÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s drug subculture. \n\nBrenda, Dicki and Boo-Boo have grown up in and around Lowell, Massachusetts. Brenda was an aspiring actress, Now she resorts to prostituion to pay for her crack addiction. &quot;I love it more than anything. More than life itself. Yet I hate it worse than anything, says Brenda. Dicki was the 'Pride of Lowell' a boxer who once fought Sugar Ray Leonard. He commits robberies to support his habit. Boo-Boo has spent the last twenty years smoking crack, shoplifting, and doing whatever he has to do to stay alive. \n\nIn the eighteenth months it took to film this documentary, the camera follows these three in and out of crack houses, rehab centers and jails. Their sad struggle mirrors the despair of their home town. There are many 'Lowells' in America - where citizens are abandoned to drugs and the empty factories echo their despair. \nWARNING: This shows graphic and unsetteling drug abuse. Viewer discretion is advised. \n===================================================================\nIboga, les hommes du bois sacrE(France et Gabon, 2002) \nGilbert Kelner (France)\n\nDu Museum histoire naturelle  Paris pital du docteur Schweitzer, en passant par la for quatoriale du Gabon, Mallendi, un jeune matre gurisseur, et son pÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨re spirituel nous entranent dans un voyage initiatique sur les traces de iboga, plante visionnaire, maItresse des cEmonies secretes du culte bwiti, dans lequel on entre pour se da couvrir et se connaatre soi-ma me.

Ibogaine is a derivative of the West African root Iboga; its properties have recently been reported as an effective treatment for drug addiction. Dave is a former stockbroker whose life has spiraled out of control due to heroin addiction. A one-time millionaire, he is now reduced to petty theft as a means to supply his habit. Traditional treatments have failed to work for Dave for over a decade. Desperate to get help, Dave decides to travel out of the country for the Ibogaine treatment. Facing the Habit is an intimate look into the struggle of addiction, as Dave\\'s life is revealed before, during, and after the treatment.\n\nIt also shows the importance of effective aftercare and motivated minds to stay healthy in the long run.\n===================================================================\nIbogaine the rite of passage\n\nThe truth about a criminalized treatment for addiction\n\nIbogaineIbogaine is a substance derived from the root of the African plant Tabernanthe iboga, which grows in Gabon. This sacred plant was originally used during spiritual initiation ceremonies of the Bwiti religion. In 1962 the anti-addictive properties of ibogaine were discovered by Howard Lotsof. \n\nIbogaine is surrounded by tremendous controversy (for controversial people.) The decisions regarding the use of ibogaine in the treatment of addiction appear to be made for political and economic reasons, rather than on the basis of its efficacy.\nThis project was started over two years ago under the auspices of the Utrecht School of the Arts. Since that time it has grown significantly in its scope, and became an initiative of LunArt Productions.\nis a substance derived from the root of the African plant \n===================================================================\n\nIbogaine beyond 2000 or the Ibogaine Story (Includes: Ibogaine, A Cure for Cocaine &amp; Heroin Addiction 1998, 4 Part Series, Reporter Al White) 55 min 19 Aug, 2002 - This facinating series of clips details the use of ibogaine in addiction treatment.
