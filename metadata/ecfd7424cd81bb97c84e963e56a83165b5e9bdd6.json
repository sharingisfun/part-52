This is an Enhanced CD, which \n          contains both regular audio tracks and multimedia computer files. Korn: Jonathan     \n          Davis (vocals); Munky (guitar); Fieldy (bass guitar); David Silviera (drums).        \n          Producers: The Matrix; Atticus Ross; Leo Ross. Recording information: Henson         \n          Recording Studios, Hollywood, California (2005). This 2005 album is not only Korn&amp;#039;s  \n          initial outing for a new label (Virgin), it marks the veteran nu-metal act&amp;#039;s first   \n          record without founding guitarist Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch (who left the band after        \n          becoming a born-again Christian). Changes for the California group don&amp;#039;t stop        \n          there--SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE is largely produced by the Matrix, the team best    \n          known for providing a slick sheen on songs by Avril Lavigne and Liz Phair. Given all \n          of these transitions, it&amp;#039;s not surprising that this record seems notably different   \n          than past Korn offerings, with an industrial element both streamlining the quartet&amp;#039;s \n          sound and giving it more weight. Although guitar and bass are still prominent on     \n          these heavy tracks, greater attention is given to Jonathan Davis&amp;#039;s vocals, which are \n          unusually melodic at times (particularly on &quot;Politics&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot;), and David  \n          Silviera&amp;#039;s punishing work on the drum kit. The result is an unapologetically direct  \n          album by a revamped band that seeks to stay true to its past while looking ahead     \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and albuminfo,           \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Twisted transistor          [04:12]                                        \n                 02.Politics                    [03:17]                                        \n                 03.Hypocrites                  [03:50]                                        \n                 04.Souvenir                    [03:50]                                        \n                 05.10 or a 2 way               [04:42]                                        \n                 06.Throw me away               [04:41]                                        \n                 07.Love song                   [04:19]                                        \n                 08.Open up                     [06:15]                                        \n                 09.Coming undone               [03:20]                                        \n                 10.Getting off                 [03:25]                                        \n                 11.Liar                        [04:15]                                        \n                 12.For no one                  [03:37]                                        \n                 13.Seen it all                 [06:19]                                        \n                 14.Tearjerker                  [05:05]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               61:07 min                                       \n                                                96,6 MB                                        ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecfd7424cd81bb97c84e963e56a83165b5e9bdd6","amp;dn":"Korn-See_You_On_The_Other_Side-%28Retail%29-2005-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecfd7424cd81bb97c84e963e56a83165b5e9bdd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,253,116,36,205,129,187,151,200,78,150,62,86,168,49,101,181,233,189,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
