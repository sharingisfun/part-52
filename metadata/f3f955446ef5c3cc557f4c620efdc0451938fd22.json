At least you won&amp;#039;t need medical\ncare after listening to this release..\n\nFurther fixes include minor audio interleaving corrections in several parts\nas well as an attempted sample rate correction in &quot;Television Interviews -\nConversation with the Candidate&quot; (still not sure if this works better now).\nI&amp;#039;ve rarely witnessed such badly engineered audio on a DVD release..\n\nBut what&amp;#039;s more: watch this DVD to get to know about Ron Paul, who he is,\nwhat he stands for, and why the people in America (and around the world)\nwant him to become the next president of the U.S.A.\n\nPlease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f955446ef5c3cc557f4c620efdc0451938fd22","amp;dn":"Ron+Paul+2008+-+Hope+for+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f955446ef5c3cc557f4c620efdc0451938fd22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,249,85,68,110,245,195,204,85,127,76,98,14,253,192,69,25,56,253,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
