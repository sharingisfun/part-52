Without its groundbreaking mix of convoluted plotting, complex character interactions, surreal fantasy sequences and a continuous story arc, we would probably not have had The X-Files, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under or even The League of Gentlemen. So brew up a pot of some &quot;damn fine coffee&quot;, dig into some cherry pie, and lose yourself in David Lynch and Mark Frost&amp;#039;s murder mystery-soap opera, which unfolds, in one character&amp;#039;s words, &quot;like a beautiful dream and terrible nightmare all at once&quot;.\n\nTwin Peaks was a pop culture phenomenon, for this first series at least, until the increasingly bizarre twists and maddening teases so confounded audiences that they lost interest in just who killed Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). This series was also a career peak for most of its eclectic ensemble cast, including Kyle MacLachlan as straight-arrow FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, Michael Ontkean as local Sheriff Harry S Truman, Sherilyn Fenn as bad girl Audrey Horne, Peggy Lipton as waitress Norma Jennings and Catherine Coulson as the Log Lady. \n\nThe 4:3 picture has been digitally remastered, and is now accompanied by a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aedaccc3ad7a079862630fd94bf2a2e9346e015","amp;dn":"Twin+Peaks+-+Season+1+DVD2%2F6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aedaccc3ad7a079862630fd94bf2a2e9346e015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,237,172,204,58,215,160,121,134,38,48,253,148,191,42,46,147,70,224,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
