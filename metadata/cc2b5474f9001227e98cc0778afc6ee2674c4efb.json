Dawn French, Julia Sawalha and Liz Smith star in a ten-part adaptation of Flora Thompson&amp;#039;s magical memoir of her Oxfordshire childhood.\n\nSet in the small hamlet of Lark Rise and the wealthier neighbouring market town, Candleford, the series chronicles the daily lives of farm-workers, craftsmen and gentry at the end of the 19th Century.\n\nThis world is seen through the eyes of a teenage girl, Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan - Sugar Rush, Torchwood) as she leaves Lark Rise to start a new life under the wing of the independent and effervescent Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha - Hornblower, Pride And Prejudice) who is post-mistress at the local post office in Candleford.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/content/images/2007/12/05/larkriselead_396x222.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/content/images/2007/12/05/larkriselead_396x222.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc2b5474f9001227e98cc0778afc6ee2674c4efb","amp;dn":"Lark+Rise+to+Candleford+1x01+%5Bret0tv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc2b5474f9001227e98cc0778afc6ee2674c4efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,43,84,116,249,0,18,39,233,140,192,119,138,252,110,226,103,76,78,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
