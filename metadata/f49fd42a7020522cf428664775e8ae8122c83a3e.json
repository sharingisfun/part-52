I&amp;#039;m uploading this as an act of courtesy.\n\nI have some info, thouhg. For the album Radioaktiv - Mafia Fallout, only Pizza Tintin and Sugarspiced Suicide are direct copies. The other two songs, Grisslappan - Radioactive and Stripped, are taken from this page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.klicktrack.com/shop/release.jsp?r=26404&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.klicktrack.com/shop/release.jsp?r=26404&lt;/a&gt;\nIf you didn&amp;#039;t notice, the previews button is set to have only 30 second relays of tune. Because of this, I was forced to record each 30 seconds at a time and edit them all together. There might be a little skipping.\nAlso, Grouse in the Machinery is from their official website, http://www.epo-555.dk/ . The song itself is the last edit, on 03/05/07, so it might be updated in the future.\nAnyway, enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f49fd42a7020522cf428664775e8ae8122c83a3e","amp;dn":"epo-555+-+Dexter+Fox%2C+Mafia%2C+Radioaktiv+-+Mafia+Fallout%2C+and+one","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f49fd42a7020522cf428664775e8ae8122c83a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,159,212,42,112,32,82,44,244,40,102,71,117,232,174,129,34,200,58,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
