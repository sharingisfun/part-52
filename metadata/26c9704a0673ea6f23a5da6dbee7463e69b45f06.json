It is a carefully crafted work, grounded in timeless musical concepts, stellar production and genuinely felt artistic presence. It acknowledges its influences without parodying them and is ultimately an expression of the artist's endeavour played out through the use of modern technologies and musical techniques. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c9704a0673ea6f23a5da6dbee7463e69b45f06","amp;dn":"Pole+Folder+-+Zero+Gold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c9704a0673ea6f23a5da6dbee7463e69b45f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,201,112,74,6,115,234,111,35,165,218,109,190,231,70,62,105,180,95,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
