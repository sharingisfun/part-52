You even get the raindrops back. \n\nThis is a self installer that places the FS2004 files into FSX\n\nI have included a backup folder with the original FSX VCRain textures in it if you decide to go back to the default.\n\nRemember... use at your own risk\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10a56a9b70527994b0fa04508b725f64f7655829","amp;dn":"FSX+VC+Rain+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10a56a9b70527994b0fa04508b725f64f7655829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,165,106,155,112,82,121,148,176,250,4,80,139,114,95,100,247,101,88,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
