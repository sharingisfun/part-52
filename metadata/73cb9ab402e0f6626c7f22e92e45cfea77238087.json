The film Miracle Mile is something of a cult classic borne out of the US vs. Soviets face-off of the Reagan era, wherein a pre-E.R. Anthony Edwards accidentally intercepts information of imminent nuclear war. At this point, Tangerine Dream were a duo: Edgar Froese and Paul Haslinger, who had joined the band several years earlier with Underwater Sunlight.\n\nSqueaky clean synths play almost exclusively in minor keys, exhibiting a sense of urgency throughout meant to convey time running down in the movie. In its favor, I would say Miracle Mile sounds less incontrovertibly dated than some of their albums of just a few years earlier. Perhaps this is due to a lesser encroachment of drum programming overall, and better, less intrusive percussive sounds when these are employed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73cb9ab402e0f6626c7f22e92e45cfea77238087","amp;dn":"Tangerine+Dream+-+Miracle+Mile+%28ost%29+new+age+-+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73cb9ab402e0f6626c7f22e92e45cfea77238087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,203,154,180,2,224,246,98,108,127,34,233,46,69,207,234,119,35,128,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
