But for whatever reason, the Texas trio didn&amp;#039;t get around to unleashing a live set until the 2004 double-disc Live All Over the Place. Instead of issuing a complete show from one of their recent tours (they remain quite a force to be reckoned with live, by the way), the chaps have opted to assemble a compilation of performances from various tours. While this technique has often resulted in flat albums for bands in the past, it actually works out well here, as it&amp;#039;s constructed similarly to the set list utilized during the group&amp;#039;s tour in support of Black Like Sunday. For the most part, it can be split into three sections -- starting off &quot;electric,&quot; going into an acoustic set in the middle, and then wrapping things up with a return to amplification. Most of the expected King&amp;#039;s X classics are included here -- &quot;Dogman,&quot; &quot;Over My Head&quot; (included as both electric and acoustic versions), &quot;Summerland,&quot; and the jamfest &quot;Moan Jam.&quot; But it&amp;#039;s the underrated album cuts that put this set over the top, especially a gorgeous reading of &quot;The Difference,&quot; &quot;Believe,&quot; &quot;Talk to You,&quot; and another jam-heavy track, &quot;Visions.&quot; Also, kudos to King&amp;#039;s X for not overdubbing this set to death -- especially with the majority of rock bands going Pro Tools crazy during the early 21st century.
