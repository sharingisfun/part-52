Gamers are faced with a series of bomb modules split into tiers and each tier must be disabled to unlock the next. As a tier is disabled the player moves closer to the detonator at the core of the bomb which must be deactivated before moving onto a new challenge. Single player action includes story, arcade and challenge modes while multiplayer mode challenges four players in a series of head to head gaming action. The story in Smart Bomb begins a decade ago, an unknown aggressor held the world to ransom with a series of highly sophisticated AI bombs planted at key locations around the globe. In response, the Global Defence Network assembled an elite reaction force Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Bomb Disposal Unit (B.D.U.) to neutralize the threat and restore order.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4fea38312fe700d3f2188adf5c1906e5a17584b","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5DSmart+Bomb%5BUSA%5D+%2B+Launcher.ra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4fea38312fe700d3f2188adf5c1906e5a17584b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,254,163,131,18,254,112,13,63,33,136,173,245,193,144,110,90,23,88,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
