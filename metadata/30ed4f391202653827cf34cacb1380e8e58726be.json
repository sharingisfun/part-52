Kind of slow, but a real treat for fans of Angela Mao, the undisputed Queen of Kung Fu. The story is a blatant rip-off of &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; (1973), where a woman goes to prison while trying to avenge her husband&amp;#039;s murder and eventually gives birth to a daughter who is destined to walk the bloody path of vengeance. The daughter is angelic Angela Mao, and she is sent to a Buddhist monastery after her mother dies in labor. After twenty years she has learned a good deal of kung fu and wishes to learn why such hatred and desire to kill burns in her heart. When she learns of her parents&amp;#039; sad fate, she determines to kill the bandits who were responsible. With the aid of several others, she manages to take them all out one by one, with the film ending as the final man falls.\n\nCourtesy Of Alex Smits.\n\nCast: \tAngela Mao  ||  Michael Chan  ||  Bruce Leung  ||  Dean Shek  ||  Wang Lai  ||  Sammo Hung  ||  Tony Liu  ||  Corey Yuen  ||  Hsu Hsia  ||  Alan Chui  ||  San Kuai  ||  Billy Chan  ||  Yuen Biao  ||  Yuen Shun-Yi  ||  Yuen Wah  ||  Yuen Yat Choh  ||  Lam Ching Ying  ||  Chung Faat  ||  Chin Yuet Sang  ||  Brandy Yuen  ||  Mars \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
