More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\n\n\nThis week I show you some stuff about the Pencil and Brush tools. They share common options with a lot of other tools and I cover them in detail. Ever wondered how to draw a straight line? Or how to pick a new colour without changing the tool you are using just now? I?ll tell you about it.\n\nAnd you?ll see a bit about the advantages of using a graphics tablet. I?ll do a longer video about that in the future. But first I have to build a new schedule for my school and manage the end of the old and the start of the new semester.
