Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very conscious and inventive in their use of language. These traits seem to be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine we are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of most of us before adolescence. Thus, linguistic invention in most subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious process. Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a game to be played for conscious pleasure. Their inventions thus display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence. Further, the electronic media which knit them together are fluid, `hot&amp;#039; connections, well adapted to both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated specimens.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:047fb870931683a9f22e7f22d3db19cb46bb77e3","amp;dn":"The+Hacker%5C%27s+Dictionary+eBooK+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"047fb870931683a9f22e7f22d3db19cb46bb77e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,127,184,112,147,22,131,169,242,46,127,34,211,219,25,203,70,187,119,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
