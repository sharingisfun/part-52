Warped and whispery synthesized sounds \n        establish the otherworldly origin of the silver entity, \n        while the theme itself, a constant unresolved pull \n        between the V and VI chords, is an at times noble, at times \n        menacing minor mode melody, often played by the strings \n        and trombones. As the piece progresses, so does the theme&amp;#039;s \n        ominousness, with the fading out of the theme proper in \n        favor of towering hits by the orchestra and choir (and \n        sometimes electric guitars) on the alternating chords. This \n        triple-meter theme is a giant ticking clock, heralding the \n        coming of the Devourer of Worlds, a distant cousin to \n        Gustav Holst&amp;#039;s &quot;Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age&quot;. A \n        brilliant overture for the album and quite simply the best \n        musical representation of the Silver Surfer.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f00c33ad536a0334cb71a56d5769b22141dc3d5","amp;dn":"OST-Fantastic_Four-Rise_Of_The_Silver_Surfer-2007-EON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f00c33ad536a0334cb71a56d5769b22141dc3d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,0,195,58,213,54,160,51,76,183,26,86,213,118,155,34,20,29,195,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
