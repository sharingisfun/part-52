A Certain Someone\n\nInformation:\n\n\tStadium Arcadium is a double album released by the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2006. Originally it was to be released in three volumes each spanning over a course of six months, but due to the band\\&amp;#039;s writing routine they believed it would be time to start writing again before the final volume would even hit stores. Members were then forced to choose out of the 38 songs they had recorded which ones would be on the new album. This left behind many tracks that would become b-sides. They were eventually released on singles for the album Stadium Arcadium. However there still could be more material recorded in the album sessions that still hasn\\&amp;#039;t surfaced.\n\n\tStadium Arcadium - Venus is a compilation that includes all the released b-sides from the album. Venus was chosen as the planet to represent the compilation for several reasons. One, it has a dramatically different color than that of Mar or Jupiter. Two, it is often referred to as the \\&quot;forgotten planet\\&quot; symbolizing the forgotten album tracks left off of Stadium Arcadium. Three, it begins with a \\&quot;V\\&quot; which gives it a nice alphabetical touch to your mp3 collection as it falls below the first two discs of the album. \n\n\tI personally hate tracks just being by themselves in my music collection therefore I put together this compilation. It looks nice when you add it to your library on iTunes and I treat it like an actual disc to the album. Pretty much did this one for myself.\n\nFarewell: Hope you enjoy. This is the fifth release. \n\nCredits to: Expedience from piratebay.org for providing the original tracks.\n\nReleases:\n1_Guns N\\&amp;#039; Roses - Appetite for Democracy\n2_Metallica - \\&quot;The New Album\\&quot; (Live Bootlegs)\n3_Nine Inch Nails - Holding_On\n4_Trent Reznor/Peter Murphy - Radioshows\n5_Red Hot Chili Peppers - Stadium Arcadium: Venus (B-Sides Compilation)\n\n\n(foog release, where nothing is original, but repackaged) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d1358a67b5821b53509bf88eeb2146cdc6626f8","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+Stadium+Arcadium%3A+Venus+%28B-Sides+Compila","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d1358a67b5821b53509bf88eeb2146cdc6626f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,19,88,166,123,88,33,181,53,9,191,136,238,178,20,108,220,102,38,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
