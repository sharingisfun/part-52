Not all L.A. garage rock was great, and this 25-song compilation (much of which has appeared on previous vinyl garage anthologies, Pebbles included) is a good way to ferret out some of the better rare singles of the genre. Terry Randall's protest rocker &quot;S.O.S.,&quot; the Rumors' &quot;Louie Louie&quot; ripoff &quot;Hold Me Now,&quot; Byron &amp; the Mortals' organ-driven &quot;Do You Believe Me,&quot; the Dovers' Byrds-meets-the-Zombies &quot;She's Not Just Anybody&quot; -- all are among the best garage classics. Most of the rest is pretty good, if a bit generic at times.\n\nTracks\n1. Terry Randall - &quot;S.O.S.&quot; (2:17)\n2. Gigolos - &quot;She's My Baby&quot; (2:59)\n3.
