Born in 1971, he has been playing the piano since he was five. He graduated from the Stanislaw Moniuszko Conservatory in Gdansk in 1996, having developed his interest in jazz at the age of 18 at high school. He started his jazz career by joining the band of clarinet player Emil Kowalski, but he considers that his true development began with the Milosc Band in 1991. A year later, he received an individual citation from the Jazz Junior Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ92 International Competition in Krakow, followed immediately by many other prizes, including the Krzysztof Komeda Prize 1992 from the Polish Culture Foundation, the First Prize of the International Jazz Improvisation Competition in Katowice in 1994, the Mateusz Swiecicki Prize from Polish Radio 3, the Mayor of GdanskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s medal for outstanding artistic achievements, and the Fryderyk Prize for Jazz Musician of 1998, as well as many citations in the magazine Jazz Forum, including being nominated six times as Best Pianist between 1993 and 1998. \n\nDuring the six years in which Mozdzer led Milosc, it became the most popular jazz group in Poland. He recorded six albums with the group, including two with the American trumpeter, Lester Bowie. At the same time, he was a star attraction of the Zbigniew Namyslowski Quartet. Mozdzer has performed with many outstanding Polish jazz musicians, including Tomasz Stanko (Farewell to Mary), Janusz Muniak (One and Four), Michael Urbaniak ( Live in Holy City), and Piotr Wojtasik (Lonely Town, Quest). He has also collaborated with such international stars as Arthur Blythe, Buster Williams, Billy Harper, Joe Lovano and Archie Shepp. Mozdzer has recorded 30 CDs, including four under his own name, the best known of which is Chopin Impressions. \n\nLeszek Mozdzer has given concerts in Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, USA, Hungary and France. At the prestigious Piano Festival in Chartres, his jazz interpretations of ChopinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pieces received a standing ovation. \n\nSince 1992 he has been a regular collaborator with Zbigniew Preisner, taking part in the recording of many of the composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film scores. 10 Easy Pieces for Piano, a suite of piano improvisations, was specially written by Preisner for Mozdzer. \n\n&gt;Tango with Lady M.&lt; \n\nConcept and choreography: Ewa Wycichowska\nMusic: Leszek Mo&amp;#380;d&amp;#380;er, Astor Piazzolla\nStage Design and costumes: Maria Balcerek\nPremiere: 28.01.2000 \nDuration: 80 minutes\n\n\nThe theme which inspired realisators of performance reach not only Shakespeare's motives with the fascinating figure of Lady Macbeth, but also ancient myth about Medea and present day events.\nHowever we are not interested in the history and apotheosis of the crime. Drama and strangeness of human life is in this performance the point of exit to reflection about the idea of being good and evil, about one person and a group, responsibility for everything what one is doing and the wisdom to forgive, also today.\n\nDance in this performance is not only the way of expression but also the way of understanding to each other. The key is tango motive, the dance of passion, the Theatre of our soul, the knot of sacrum and profanum.\nTango with Lady M. is also our proposition to talk, to say that the end of the century is not the end of our common, individual world.\n \n\nPolish Dance Theatre was laureate of the Hetman's Bulaw Prize for the best performance at the Zamo&amp;#347;&amp;#263; Theatre Summer 2001.\n \n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  ][LoLTEAM][ # 2005 #   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49fe72f2bf1c04818b6cb32e84b29acbc9ff723d","amp;dn":"Leszek+Mo%C2%BFd%C2%BFer+-+Tango+z+Lady+M+-+2004+-+%5D%5BLoLTEAM%5D%5B+RELEASE.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49fe72f2bf1c04818b6cb32e84b29acbc9ff723d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,254,114,242,191,28,4,129,139,108,179,46,132,178,154,203,201,255,114,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
