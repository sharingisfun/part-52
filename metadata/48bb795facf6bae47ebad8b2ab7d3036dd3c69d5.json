The win actual release version is 2.0 build 67. Don&amp;#039;t know which version is this Linux variant, coz I don&amp;#039;t tested yet (only the win variant build 67, which works just fine). Guess that is at least 2.0.65, just becoz I&amp;#039;ve included here the WIN32 keygen for it (to be used with wine, or under win) and the serial for the 67 build. I&amp;#039;m looking forward to finding the exact matching crack for this one. When I&amp;#039;ll find it will post it here. Thanks for the patience. Anyways... enjoy it, guys!\n\nMore info about in the NFO file inside torrent and on homepage.
