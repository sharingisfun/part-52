It was originally released in April 2003. It was subsequently presented in the United States as a two-part series by the Discovery Channel and its affiliates.\n\nThe documentary was produced largely by the same team who produced the award-winning documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts, though the original series&amp;#039; director, Tim Haines was not involved. In the previous documentaries, extinct animals were recreated with CGI and animatronics. For Walking with Cavemen, a slightly different approach was taken. While most of the animals depicted were still computer generated or animatronic, the human ancestors were portrayed by actors wearing makeup and prosthetics, giving them a more realistic look and permitting the actors to give the creatures a human quality.\n\nLike its predecessors, Walking with Cavemen is made in the style of a wildlife documentary, featuring a voice-over narrator (Robert Winston in the British release, Alec Baldwin in the North American release) who describes the recreations of the prehistoric past as if they are real. As with the predecessors, this approach necessitated the presentation of speculation as if it is fact, and some of the statements made about the behaviour of the creatures are more open to question than the documentary may indicate.\n\nEach species segment takes the form of a short drama featuring a group of the particular hominid in question going about their daily lives (the search for food, protecting territory, and caring for the sick and injured). The intent is to get the human viewer to feel for the creatures being examined, almost to imagine being one of them (a trait that the documentary links to the modern human brain).\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_Cavemen\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Author/Presenter - Robert Winston\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor Lord Robert Winston was born in 1940 and named Robert Maurice \nWinston.

Australopithecus afarensis has taken the first tentative steps towards humanity by standing and walking on two legs. Just a few million years previously, Africa was covered, almost edge-to-edge, with dense rain forest. Our ancestors almost certainly used all four limbs to move and live and hunt in their tree-top homes. But massive geological turmoil changed their destiny. The rift valley was forming, and the rain forests dying as Africa dried out - turning the landscape into a mosaic of scattered trees and grass. In this new environment afarensis found it more efficient to move about on two legs rather than four.\n\nThis film follows a close-knit troop of afarensis, and in particular, Lucy and her young infant. Led by a strong alpha male, there is harmony in their lives. They sleep high in the trees and spend most of the day foraging for food. As the troop&amp;#039;s life moves on, &amp;#039;First Ancestors&amp;#039; shows how although bi-pedalism offers only slight advantages to the afarensis, it opens the door to an astonishing set of new skills and abilities that will change the shape of human life on Earth forever.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa1854f4d1fd674b4c679394a8177e68ec70e8c0","amp;dn":"BBC+Walking+With+Cavemen+1+of+4+Robert+Winston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa1854f4d1fd674b4c679394a8177e68ec70e8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,24,84,244,209,253,103,75,76,103,147,148,168,23,126,104,236,112,232,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
