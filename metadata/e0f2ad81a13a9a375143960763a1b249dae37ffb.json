And I just wanted to learn the process of creating a torrent and uploading it.\nYou can expect a lot of good stuff from the pirate_son.\n\nVery soon you&amp;#039;ll get from me:\n-My whole mp3 collection (which includes: nirvana, and the all grunge that you can imagine.)\n-My software collection (Which includes: lots of useful programs with keygens)\n-All the rest: music videos, e-books, many more\n\nThe idea is to set up an internet site where you can see all my files in a very organized way, so you can search whatever you want, and then go to pirate bay and download the respective torrent.\n\nI hope it all works fine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0f2ad81a13a9a375143960763a1b249dae37ffb","amp;dn":"some+songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0f2ad81a13a9a375143960763a1b249dae37ffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,242,173,129,161,58,154,55,81,67,150,7,99,161,178,73,218,227,127,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
