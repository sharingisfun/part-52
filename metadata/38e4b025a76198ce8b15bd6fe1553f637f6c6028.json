Despite his small stature, Valiant's ambitions are enormous as he keeps a stiff upper beak and endures rigorous training in preparation for a dangerous mission to deliver vital messages to troops behind enemy lines. With a shortage of wingpower in the royal fleet due to increased attacks by a brigade of vicious enemy falcons (led by the ruthless General Von Talon), the mission falls to Valiant and the unlikely heroes of &quot;Squad F&quot; to try and save the day. With a wing and a prayer, Valiant and his fine feathered pals fly into harm's way and prove that it's not the size of the wingspan that counts, but the size of the spirit. \nGenres: Comedy, Kids/Family and Animation \n\n\nthese r vob files should let u copy str8 2 dvd if using nero\n\noffical release august 19th","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e4b025a76198ce8b15bd6fe1553f637f6c6028","amp;dn":"valiant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e4b025a76198ce8b15bd6fe1553f637f6c6028","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,228,176,37,167,97,152,206,139,21,189,111,225,85,63,99,127,108,96,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
