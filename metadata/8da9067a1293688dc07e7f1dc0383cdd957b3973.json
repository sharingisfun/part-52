A burnt-out, haunted rock star goes bonkers amid a scenario rife with symbolism, vivid animated sequences, and glorious Pink Floyd songs. Bob Geldof gives a powerful performance as the musician Pink; notable work is also done by Eleanor David as Pink&amp;#039;s wife and Bob Hoskins as Pink&amp;#039;s manager. The &quot;plot&quot; works surprisingly well within the confines of the music, but it&amp;#039;s unfortunate that so much of Pink&amp;#039;s problems in The Wall are blamed on the women in his life ÃƒÂ¢?? his mother and wife.\n\n\nName.........................: Pink Floyd The Wall_1982_dvdrip_xvid_ac3_ekolb\nLength.......................: 01h 35m 09s \n\n[Video]\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nOrig.
