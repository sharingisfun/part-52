I live in New York and saw them 5 times during this time and loved every show.  For those of you that have listened to my first creation, A Mix Of All That Was, this is just like what I did there but only in the time frame of 2005-2007.  IÃƒÂ¢??m actually very proud of how this turned out and I think it sounds much better.  It flows more smoothly, mostly because itÃƒÂ¢??s the same band the whole time with the same style of play.  I collected 120 bootlegs of NIN concerts from 2005-2007 and have put together a track listing of 60 songs, one of every song played live during this time frame.  Each track is, in my opinion, the &quot;best performance&quot; of the song.  I mixed them together to sound, to the best of my ability, like one continues concert.  There are some obvious examples of where the tracks change but for the most part it flows pretty nicely.  The songs were picked because of some quality that made them stand out to me such as unique lyrics, interesting sounds, instrumental solos, or something else completely like Trent getting pissed off at the audio or visual guys.  Trust me listening to 115 tracks of head like a hole isnÃƒÂ¢??t as fun as it might seem... The sound quality isnÃƒÂ¢??t always the best; mainly because that wasnÃƒÂ¢??t the only thing I judged the songs on.  Only tracks played during concerts with the actual band (no guest appearances) I included, so all the radio shows, the few songs with Peter Murphy and Saul Williams, and TrentÃƒÂ¢??s solo performances arenÃƒÂ¢??t included on here. If you want to hear those tracks I recommend downloading them yourself because their separate entities on their own. This is 99% FLAC sourced, wish isn&amp;#039;t.  Special thanks to all of the tapers that decided to share their recordings and of course to the guys in nine inch nails who are fucking awesome.  I spend around two months working on this, from picking out the tracks to mixing them together, so I hope you all enjoy it.  And trust me, there is something pretty funny on the bonus track.  \nSend all feedback to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9bd5f4eff2f5d8f5c8eff4ebd6fed5f4ecdbfcf6faf2f7b5f8f4f6b5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt;
