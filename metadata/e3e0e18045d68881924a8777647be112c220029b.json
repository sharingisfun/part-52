Ubisoft always manages to fuck up the interface, this game has a much better one. Though its AI is a couple of notches poorer (it really sucks at tactics), I think it's a more fitting choice for anyone who isn't an advanced tournament player. It gives better info and &quot;analysis&quot; and the mini-games are very useful for the novice/average player.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e0e18045d68881924a8777647be112c220029b","amp;dn":"Scrabble_Complete-Razor1911","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e0e18045d68881924a8777647be112c220029b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,224,225,128,69,214,136,129,146,74,135,119,100,123,225,18,194,32,2,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
