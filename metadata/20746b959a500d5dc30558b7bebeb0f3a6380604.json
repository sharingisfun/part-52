In addition to exhausting social agencies and draining community finances, meth also leaves in its turbulent wake addiction, crime, burn victims, neglected children and toxic properties. Educational and compelling, CRANK: DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN measures meth&amp;#039;s devastating impact on one Tennessee town. The documentary examines meth&amp;#039;s introduction as a deadly drug phenomenon, profiles legislation aimed at controlling the sale of meth-precursor cold medicines and reveals the hard lessons families learn about addiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20746b959a500d5dc30558b7bebeb0f3a6380604","amp;dn":"PBS%5B2007%5DCRANK.Darkness.On.The.Edge.Of.Town","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20746b959a500d5dc30558b7bebeb0f3a6380604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,116,107,149,154,80,13,93,195,5,88,183,190,190,176,243,166,56,6,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
