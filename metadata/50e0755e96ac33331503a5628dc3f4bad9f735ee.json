The music is heavy blues-rock with light prog touches, but not &quot;heavy&quot; in the same way like many such bands of the time tended to be. Singer/guitarist Joey Albrecht has a rather good, strong voice with a heavy accent that adds to the charm of this record. Lots of good Santana-esque instrumental work thru-out the album, with jazzy keyboards, heavy guitars and South American rhythms. Not an essential album to have in the collection but very well worth having a listen to imho.\n\n256kbs\nCOver included\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Pacemaker \t  \t  \t\n2. I Dont Care \t  \t  \t\n3.
