Packed with next generation sounds,      \nunexpected passages and his trademark sampling,    \nthis release is a wicked pentadelic circus        \ncarousel that takes you on a wild journey through  \nnight and day.                                    \nFrom deep and dark &amp;#039;No More Evil&amp;#039; to the funky    \nand unpredictable &amp;#039;BBQ&amp;#039; to the vocal and full-on  \n&amp;#039;Neo Cheesy&amp;#039; this album is for everyone. Drawing  \nfrom his experience in working at the Soviet      \nnuclear laboratory, Nikita has made sure that      \nevery track will detonate properly on every dance  \nfloor, - huge and tiny.                            \nlink: www.pentafiles.com                    \nTracks                                        \n#  track                            length    \n01  Vegetarian Ballad                  08:28    \n02  BBQ                                08:35    \n03  Time Jump                          09:01    \n04  Andes                              07:40    \n05  Men Dozed                          07:57    \n06  Piscotech                          07:17    \n07  No More Evil                      07:59    \n08  Magic Balls                        07:31    \n09  Neo Cheesy                        08:34    \nNews                                          \nCurrently groov[e]mission is looking for talented    \nrippers  who can  supply quality electronic music  \n(CD&amp;#039;s / vinyl / promos or livesets,  at least you        \nshould  be  able  to  order  from  online  stores    \n*frequently*!) mainly  psychedelic &amp; ambient  but      \nall  other  good  electronic  music  is  welcome      \naswell!
