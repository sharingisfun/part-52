Artois is the owner and manager of a caf?? in German-occupied France of World War II. To look at him, it&amp;#039;s hard to believe that some women find him irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith. Ren??&amp;#039;s cafe, frequented by both the German military and the French resistance, is the focal point for the show. Ren??&amp;#039;s a bit of a coward and is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the cafe are two English airmen who don&amp;#039;t understand a word of French. Other characters include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his small sidekick. Ren??&amp;#039;s not the only coward in town: Capt. Hans Geering and Col. Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive along with Capt. Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army, who has a medal for servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an English agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of &quot;Zee Fronch Linguige&quot;, and from Ren??&amp;#039;s amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e9949f2b3cac38bc91e2cfb4481535cc0c4e15","amp;dn":"Allo+Allo+DVD+5%2F5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e9949f2b3cac38bc91e2cfb4481535cc0c4e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,233,148,159,43,60,172,56,188,145,226,207,180,72,21,53,204,12,78,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
