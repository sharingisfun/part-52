For more information, see the chapter System Encryption in the documentation.   (Windows Vista/XP/2003)\n* Pipelined operations increasing read/write speed by up to 100%   (Windows)\n* Mac OS X version\n* Graphical user interface for the Linux version of TrueCrypt\n* XTS mode of operation, which was designed by Phillip Rogaway in 2003 and which was recently approved as the IEEE 1619 standard for cryptographic protection of data on block-oriented storage devices. XTS is faster and more secure than LRW mode (for more information on XTS mode, see the section Modes of Operation in the documentation).\n\n  Note: New volumes created by this version of TrueCrypt can be encrypted only in XTS mode. However, volumes created by previous versions of TrueCrypt can still be mounted using this version of TrueCrypt.\n\n* SHA-512 hash algorithm (replacing SHA-1, which is no longer available when creating new volumes).\n\n  Note: To re-encrypt the header of an existing volume with a header key derived using HMAC-SHA-512 (PRF), select &amp;#039;Volumes&amp;#039; &gt; &amp;#039;Set Header Key Derivation Algorithm&amp;#039;.\n\nImprovements, bug fixes, and security enhancements:\n\n* The Linux version of TrueCrypt has been redesigned so that it will no longer be affected by changes to the Linux kernel (kernel upgrades/updates).\n* Many other minor improvements, bug fixes, and security enhancements.  (Windows and Linux)\n\nIf you are using an older version of TrueCrypt, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to this version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef9b25dd17dfff7fc0b4e11a28fed48de5e2593a","amp;dn":"TrueCrypt+Setup+5.0+for+Mac+OS+X+Leopard+PowerPC+%28.dmg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef9b25dd17dfff7fc0b4e11a28fed48de5e2593a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,155,37,221,23,223,255,127,192,180,225,26,40,254,212,141,229,226,89,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
