Once referred to by Jimmy Page (of Led Zeppelin of course) as &quot;my favorite band&quot;... Legend has it that Mr. Page copped the idea of playing his guitar with a violin bow from the man, David Lindley himself...\n Here you&amp;#039;ll find not only the six albums they recorded through the years, but also bonus material, everything that&amp;#039;s turned up on CD plus a couple of goodies. In short, everything they recorded that&amp;#039;s out there you&amp;#039;ll find here. I could tell you all about these guys, but I will let their music speak for them...\n\nSo now without further ado...\n\nSIDE TRIPS                                         ( 1967 )                     EPIC BN 26304 \nDavid Lindley - banjo, fiddle, mandolin, guitar, harp-guitar and 7-string banjo\nSolomon Feldthouse- saz bouzoukee, dobro, vina, doumbeg, dulcimer, fiddle and 12 string guitar\nFenrus Epp (AKA Chester Crill)- violin, viola, bass, piano, organ and harmonica\nChris Darrow- banjo, mandolin, fiddle, autoharp, harmonica and clarinet\nJohn Vidican- percussion \n \n\nEgyptian Gardens         3:05\nIf The Night                  1:45\nHesitation Blues           2:25 \nPlease                            3:10\nKeep Your Mind Open  2:15            \nPulsating Dream              1:58   \nOh Death                          3:25 \nCome On In                        2:07\nWhy Try                             3:43\nMinnie The Moocher       2:13\n\nProduced by Barry Friedman (AKA Frazier Mohawk)\nfor Your Management Company\nProduction supervised by Mike Goldberg\n \n&quot;Their music? It&amp;#039;s inventive, imaginative, intense and an amalgam of many divergent influences- sounds that range from old-time ragtime blues to exotic, drone-and-bells, minor keyed music of Greece and Turkey.
