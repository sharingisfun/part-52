A rather routine slab of bluesy, heavy rock, it made the Top 50. Aside from Bolin&amp;#039;s extended hard rock riffing, it prominently featured the lead vocals of Candy Givens, who affected a blues-wailing pose along the lines of Janis Joplin. But she didn&amp;#039;t have the full throat or guts to back it up, ending up closer to also-ran female psychedelic singers like Lydia Pense (of Cold Blood). Zephyr recorded one more album before Bolin left for stints with James Gang, Deep Purple, and a solo career; the group carried on with little success throughout the 1970s.\n\nZephyr&amp;#039;s debut on BGO finds Tommy Bolin already developed as a skilled player, but his playing, and the largely group-penned material, lacks strength or subtlety. The most distinctive trait of the band at this point, in fact, is the somewhat histrionic singing of lead vocalist Candy Givens.
