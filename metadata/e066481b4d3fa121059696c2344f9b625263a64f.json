Overhearing their neighbours in the next flat plotting to hold up a group of out-of-their-depth drug growers, our heros decide to stitch up the robbers in turn. In a way the confusion really starts when a pair of antique double-barrelled shotguns go missing in a completely different scam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e066481b4d3fa121059696c2344f9b625263a64f","amp;dn":"Lock%2C+Stock+and+Two+Smoking+Barrels+%281998%29+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e066481b4d3fa121059696c2344f9b625263a64f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,102,72,27,77,63,161,33,5,150,150,194,52,79,155,98,82,99,166,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
