WEB is  a service that packages  webgroup releases\nproperly to be traded on scene sites.  The release group nfo is included in this\nrelease.\n\nThis is not done to get &amp;#039;credit&amp;#039;  for these releases.  All credit is  due to the\ngroup  who cracked this.  However, warez should  be on warez sites and WEB makes\nthat happen.  This release is  not &amp;#039;stolen&amp;#039; from  the release group  because WEB\ndoes not gain anything from this release. WEB does not have or deserve affils.\n\nThese releases  are tagged as -WEB instead of  by their release group or as -iND\nto make it easier for sites to recognize these releases for what they are.\n\nIf a real  scene group wants to crack and release anything released by WEB, they\nshould certainly do so.  WEB is not intended to take any releases away from real\ngroups.  If anyone releases a dupe of a WEB release, the WEB  should be nuked as\ndupe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56919d536f18717f8e4a45ecabfba4965057776a","amp;dn":"Folder.Encryption.Fairy.v3.6.Cracked-SnD-WEB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56919d536f18717f8e4a45ecabfba4965057776a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,145,157,83,111,24,113,127,142,74,69,236,171,251,164,150,80,87,119,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
