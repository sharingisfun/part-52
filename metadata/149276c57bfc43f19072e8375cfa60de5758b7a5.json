Down-and-out former professional Ping-Pong phenom Randy Daytona (Tony Award winner Dan Fogler) is sucked into this maelstrom when FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) recruits him for a secret mission. Randy is determined to bounce back and recapture his former glory, and to smoke out his father\\&amp;#039;s (Robert Patrick) killer ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ one of the FBI\\&amp;#039;s Most Wanted, arch-fiend Feng (Academy Award winner Christopher Walken). But, after two decades out of the game, Randy can\\&amp;#039;t turn his life around and avenge his father\\&amp;#039;s murder without a team of his own. He calls upon the spiritual guidance of blind Ping-Pong sage and restaurateur Wong (James Hong), and the training expertise of Master Wong\\&amp;#039;s wildly sexy niece Maggie (Maggie Q), both of whom also have a dark history with Feng. All roads lead to Feng\\&amp;#039;s mysterious jungle compound and the most unique Ping-Pong tournaments ever staged. There, Randy faces such formidable players as his long-ago Olympics opponent, the still-vicious Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon). Can Randy keep his eye on the ball? Will he achieve the redemption he craves while wielding a paddle? Is his backhand strong enough to triumph over rampant wickedness?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndirector  :Robert Ben Garant\n               \ncast      :Christopher walken \n          :Dan Fogler\n\t  :george lopez\n          :Terry Crews\n\t\n\n\nlenght........01.30.26\n\nsize..........700 mb\n\nframe rate....23/second\n\ntotal bitrate.135 kbps \n\naudio bitrate.112 kbps dolby digital\n\nformat........avi\n\nresolution....720x576\n\nLanguage......english\n\nRelease Date..29 August 2007\n\n\n\n\n         please seed if you can:thumbsup:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:149276c57bfc43f19072e8375cfa60de5758b7a5","amp;dn":"balls+of+fury+dvdrip+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"149276c57bfc43f19072e8375cfa60de5758b7a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,146,118,197,123,252,67,241,144,114,232,55,92,250,96,222,87,88,183,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
