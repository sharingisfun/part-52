It is perfectly safe to delete these files.\n\n\nFIXES\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPATCH 1.2:\n\n* Fixed a bug where some saved games were being corrupted during the save process. Saved games are only usable by the PC and user that created them.\n\n* Includes a new set of leaderboards. These are separate to the existing leaderboards which will remain visible for people playing version 1.0 or 1.1.\n\n* Also includes fixes of patch 1.1\n\n\n\nPATCH 1.1:\n\n* Fixed a bug where entering the options menu inside the game with no active sound card present would cause the game to crash.\n\n* The game will now display an error message and prompt the user to quit the game when graphics settings are set beyond their hardware capabilities.\n\n* Fixed an issue where on rare occasions vehicle&amp;#039;s bonnets/wings would be invisible on entering a race.\n\n* Corrected the minor miss spelling of Portuguese in the game.\n\n* Fixed a bug that caused the game to crash when regaining focus from another application, or the desktop.\n\n* The sound mixer now defaults to SOFTWARE, for improved game performance. D3D and OPENAL are still available, for higher quality.\n\n* Increased maximum Head-cam movement speed by 50%\n\n* 5 axes mode support for Thrustmaster &quot;RGT Force Feedback Pro&quot; wheel\n\n* Fixed a bug where Force Feed Back on controllers would stop working after the user returned focus to the game.\n\n* Fixed a rare bug where it was possible to drive your vehicle before the start lights had gone green.\n\n* Ultra graphic settings modified slightly to be usable with hardware of today.\n\n* Improvements in performance of both internal audio, and external OpenAL drivers\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nunrar with latest Winrar!...\n\ndelivered 1st by -ToeD\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c7ee5953dbd908bbb321e25cbe0c6ac94174c9","amp;dn":"PC_DiRT%3F+Colin...PATCH+1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c7ee5953dbd908bbb321e25cbe0c6ac94174c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,199,238,89,83,219,217,8,187,179,33,226,92,190,12,106,201,65,116,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
