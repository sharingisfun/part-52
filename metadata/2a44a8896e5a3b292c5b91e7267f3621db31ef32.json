Newcomer Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a 15-year-old high-school student with a minor yet socially alienating (and painful) disability: he stutters uncontrollably. Determined to work through the problem, Hal opts for an extreme route -- he joins the school debating team, which sends him on a headfirst plunge into breakneck speech competitions -- and offers a much-needed boost toward correcting the problem. Blitz, like his onscreen alter ego, struggled with a stammer as a young man -- a disability he eventually surmounted -- which imparted him with a lifelong interest in speech and storytelling.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a44a8896e5a3b292c5b91e7267f3621db31ef32","amp;dn":"Rocket+Science+%5B2007%5D.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a44a8896e5a3b292c5b91e7267f3621db31ef32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,68,168,137,110,90,59,41,44,91,145,231,38,127,54,33,219,49,239,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
