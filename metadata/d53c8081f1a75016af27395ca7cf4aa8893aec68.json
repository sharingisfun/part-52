(Japanese anime-speak for &quot;look out!&quot;) evolved from jam sessions involving members of Boston's psychedelic-rock elite. Past Abunai! excursions have pegged the band as a dozen different mythical New England outfits (MYSTIC RIVER SOUND) or as the missing link between Hawkwind, H.P. Lovecraft, Fairport Convention, and Funkadelic (UNIVERSAL MIND DECODER). Expertly pieced together from hours of improv sessions, ROUND WOUND honors the live-band jam roots so central to the Abunai! aesthetic. ROUND WOUND's kaleidoscopic collage of studio recordings incorporates both spacey fragments and epic escapades, all layered and sequenced for maximum acid-jam effect. Kris Thompson's vortex-like keyboards, Joe Turner's driven drumming, Dan Parmenter's soulful, funk-fueled basslines, and Brendan Quinn's multi-layered guitars coalesce in a potent, 80-minute cut-and-paste head trip of Teutonic proportions. One must look back to Amon Duul I's PSYCHEDELIC UNDERGROUND (1969) and Agitation Free's mammoth MALESCH (1972)--both similarly assembled from tapes--for anything quite as grand or organic. \n\n\n224VBr\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n1.
