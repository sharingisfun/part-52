This album is a sprawling, layered piece of East Coast Canadian &quot;Brit pop&quot;. Inspired by bands such as Coldplay, Sproll play emotive, melodic pop, catchy and ready to rock your radio.\n\nThis release expands upon the Soft Science sound and finds the band rocking a lot more. &quot;Heights&quot; is a great kick-off to the disc, a catchy bit of pop full of hooks and made for singing along to. &quot;Oh My Stars&quot; follows it and shows off just how great a singer Corey Hachey has become -- his vocals soar through the chorus. &quot;Radio&quot; is a great first single. It&amp;#039;s instantly catchy with a memorable chorus. &quot;Every Open Door&quot; is another catchy pop rocker that could easily be a hit.\n\nGuitarist Neal MacLean&amp;#039;s carefully plucks and strums away here, with lead bits that brighten up the tight bottom end from drummer Thom Cooke and bassist Glen Farquhar.\n\nThe group fits right in with bands like In Flight Safety, Coldplay and Mobile, and with this full-length album, Sproll shows they&amp;#039;re ready to break out of the East Coast and show everyone across the country what talent we have right here in our backyard.\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4037ac4113ff583dc9cd105247c774d890c39b2b","amp;dn":"Sproll+-+Turn+On+Your+Radio+%5B2008%5D+%28VBR+mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4037ac4113ff583dc9cd105247c774d890c39b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,55,172,65,19,255,88,61,201,205,16,82,71,199,116,216,144,195,155,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
