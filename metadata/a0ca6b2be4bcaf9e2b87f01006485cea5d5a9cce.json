MÃƒÂ¶t Niklas frÃƒÂ¥n TÃƒÂ¤by och Adam frÃƒÂ¥n Kanada. BÃƒÂ¥da berÃƒÂ¤ttar om att ha Aspergers syndrom, en form av autism. Adam ÃƒÂ¤r dessutom huvudpersonen i en prisbelÃƒÂ¶nt film om hur en familj hanterar utmaningen att ha en son med Aspergers syndrom.\n\nOm filmen, som ocksÃƒÂ¥ ÃƒÂ¤r med i programmet:\n\n&quot;Am I retarded? That&amp;#039;s how kids make me feel. I don&amp;#039;t like having Asperger&amp;#039;s. I don&amp;#039;t like being considered different.&quot;\n\nBut Adam has Asperger&amp;#039;s syndrome, a type of autism that compromises his ability to socialize with other kids. He blurts out inappropriate comments. He gets angry easily. And he sometimes gets violent.\n\nAdam&amp;#039;s behaviour -- and the way it affects his family and his classmates -- is illustrated in The Boy Inside, a documentary by his mother, Marianne Kaplan, that airs Tuesday night at 10 p.m. on CBC Newsworld.\n\nThe film takes a difficult look at not only Adam and his behaviour, but at his parents&amp;#039; quest for help for their son. Asperger&amp;#039;s is a neurological disorder that is increasingly diagnosed among children, but is still far from being understood by the general public, which tends to see an outspoken, rude child rather than a child with a disorder.\n\nKaplan says she decided to turn the camera on herself and her family because, despite the difficulties of the project, she wanted to shed some honest light on a disorder that is often misunderstood.\n\nThe film sold out two screenings at the Vancouver International Film Festival, and Kaplan says she&amp;#039;s been getting incredibly positive feedback from people who have seen the documentary.\n\n&quot;I&amp;#039;ve had people say to me, &amp;#039;I had no idea how hard it was,&amp;#039;&quot; she said.\n\n&quot;It&amp;#039;s exciting to be a part of that and to feel that one&amp;#039;s particular personal story can touch so many people.&quot;\n\nMany people first heard of Asperger&amp;#039;s a couple of years ago when Mark Haddon&amp;#039;s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime became a best-selling phenomenon. The novel was told from the perspective of a 15-year-old boy with Asperger&amp;#039;s.\n\nBut as Kaplan notes, no two kids have the same symptoms of Asperger&amp;#039;s. In one of her film&amp;#039;s most touching scenes, Adam matter-of-factly questions a boy he meets at an Asperger&amp;#039;s conference about his levels of sociability.\n\nHe asks whether the other boy can make friends and keep friends, something Adam has found difficult.\n\n&quot;My son was never invited to anyone&amp;#039;s house when he was in school, barely ever. And barely ever invited to birthday parties,&quot; Kaplan says.\n\n&quot;If my son would&amp;#039;ve had a few friends during those early years, I think it would be a completely different situation now. He has such a chip on his shoulder. He&amp;#039;s almost paranoid. He doesn&amp;#039;t even know when kids are talking about him or when kids aren&amp;#039;t talking about him.&quot;\n\nThe film also shows how difficult the disorder has made life for Kaplan and her husband -- who find themselves at one point in the film realizing they talk about nothing other than their son -- and on Adam&amp;#039;s older sister, who tells her mother that life would be easier for her if she didn&amp;#039;t have to attend the same school as her brother.\n\nKaplan said B.C.&amp;#039;s Ministry of Children and Family Development has expressed interest in showing the film in the province&amp;#039;s public schools and is funding a website to connect parents of kids with Asperger&amp;#039;s to one another.\n\n&quot;It&amp;#039;s such a private experience, often an isolating experience,&quot; Kaplan said. &quot;Some behaviours are so odd they&amp;#039;re almost embarrassing to talk about.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0ca6b2be4bcaf9e2b87f01006485cea5d5a9cce","amp;dn":"Vadd%C3%A5+handikappad%2C+Kunskapskanalen+om+asperger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0ca6b2be4bcaf9e2b87f01006485cea5d5a9cce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,202,107,43,228,188,175,158,43,135,240,16,6,72,92,234,93,90,156,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
