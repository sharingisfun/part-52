(HWV 1), is George Frideric Handel&amp;#039;s first opera.\n\nHandel came to the city of Hamburg in the summer of 1703 and played as a violinist in the theatre at the GÃƒÂ¤nsemarkt, the local market place. On later occasions, he also played the harpsichord in the orchestra. His first opera ? announced as a Singspiel?had its premiere on 8 January 1705 under the direction of Reinhard Keiser, so it is presumed that it must have been composed in the months directly preceding this.\n\nThe Italian libretto was written by Giulio Pancieri in Venice in 1691. Giuseppe Boninventi used it in his opera at the time. The translation used by Handel was made by Christian Feustking. While most of the recited parts and arias are sung in German, some remain untranslated.\n\n&quot;Almira&quot; was a resounding success. The opera was performed twenty times in total until its place was taken by Handel&amp;#039;s next opera, Nero, the music of which has not been preserved. In 1732 the piece was once more performed in a version edited by Georg Philipp Telemann.\n\nThe first modern performance of Almira took place during the ?Halleschen HÃƒÂ¤ndelfestspiele? (a festival dedicated to Handel) on the 4 June 1994, in Bad LauchstÃƒÂ¤dt.\n\n(From Wikipedia)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8f0e71ede21fe07350ab457810b52fdacf2f6e","amp;dn":"Handel+Almira","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc8f0e71ede21fe07350ab457810b52fdacf2f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,143,14,113,237,226,31,224,115,80,171,69,120,16,181,47,218,207,47,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
