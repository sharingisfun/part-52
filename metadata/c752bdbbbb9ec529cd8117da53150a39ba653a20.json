From the opening cut here, Amos Milburn&amp;#039;s delightful and classic &quot;Down the Road a Piece,&quot; the party gets rolling (people did the Lindy Hop to this stuff back in the day but one could easily twist, stroll and pony to it, too) with gems like Buddy Johnson&amp;#039;s boozy &quot;Walk &amp;#039;Em,&quot; Illinois Jacquet&amp;#039;s stomping &quot;Flying Home&quot; and Bullmoose Jackson&amp;#039;s takenoprisoners version of &quot;Hold Him Joe.&quot; Fun stuff, and like Joe Turner&amp;#039;s rampaging &quot;Around the Clock,&quot; it was rock roll in all but a name and a place on the time line.
