This is a great setlist.  The vocals are a bit muddy...but no worries as we all know the lyrics anyway  :)\n\nOnce again BIG THANKS to Scott Nuckles / \\&quot;Chapter 18\\&quot; from DtS for taping this and sharing it with us!\n\nLong live GBV!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43f64d751a1cd134f9f961da8ceda7e49acc1b4","amp;dn":"Guided+By+Voices+09-02-94+CST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43f64d751a1cd134f9f961da8ceda7e49acc1b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,63,100,215,81,161,205,19,79,159,150,29,168,206,218,126,73,172,193,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
