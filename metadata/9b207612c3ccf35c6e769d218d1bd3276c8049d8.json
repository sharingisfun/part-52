A captivating thirty-part lecture series by Hugh Nibley, under the general theme ?Time Vindicates the Prophets,? was featured from March 7 through October 17. Although recorded in 1954, the messages delivered in this broadcast are as interesting and relevant today as they were then, and they represent the characteristic Nibley style so many have come to appreciate. This extraordinary collection can be appropriately called ?vintage Nibley.? Material in these broadcasts was eventually the basis for Hugh Nibley?s book The World and the Prophets.\n\n8 CDs ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b207612c3ccf35c6e769d218d1bd3276c8049d8","amp;dn":"Hugh+Nibley+Time+Vindicates+the+Prophets+LDS+MORMON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b207612c3ccf35c6e769d218d1bd3276c8049d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,32,118,18,195,204,243,92,110,118,157,33,141,27,211,39,108,128,73,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
