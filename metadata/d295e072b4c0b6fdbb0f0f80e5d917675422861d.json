Over the next decade, through a combination of leaks, bootlegs and legend, those sessions would become something much more. &quot;People have been talking about these tapes ever since I recorded them,&quot; Chris Knight says. &quot;To me, they were rough and stark and I never thought they&amp;#039;d see the light of day.&quot; Ten years and four acclaimed albums later, The Trailer Tapes remain a remarkable moment in time, less captured than cornered, a portrait of the artist as a ferociously talented young man. And for the artist The New York Times would soon call &amp;#039;the last of a dying breed...a hard-nosed iconoclast with an acoustic guitar and a college degree,&quot; The Trailer Tapes have now arrived as the long-long missing first chapter of one of the most uncompromising careers in music today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d295e072b4c0b6fdbb0f0f80e5d917675422861d","amp;dn":"Chris+Knight+-+The+Trailer+Tapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d295e072b4c0b6fdbb0f0f80e5d917675422861d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,149,224,114,180,192,182,253,187,15,15,128,229,217,23,103,84,34,134,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
