For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway: This is a rare Vinyl-Rip for all you Jesus-People out there. The rip is at 192Kbps LAME mp3, and this is the real deal, no plastic-Jesus in here.. Please seed it for a while to keep it alive..\n\n&quot;Have you had Jesus-people knocking on your door?\nSaying things you've never heard before?\nWell, don't be getting mad.\nDon't be feeling sad.\nIt won't be long, they'll be gone..&quot;\n\nand\n\n&quot;I walked a mile with pleasure. She chattered all the way. Left me none the wiser with all she had to say.\nI walked a mile with sorrow. Never a word said she. But all the things I learned from her, when sorrow walked with me..&quot;\n\n..and you just got to hear Barry tell the story about when he was on a fishing boat, and encountered a dolphin, and then some.. :-) Priceless..\n\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e39586918a858a91868e828a8fa3848e828a8fcd808c8e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f6f327cf64cfadf9b8c5b5a4b0efad9d715688c","amp;dn":"Barry+McGuire+%26+2.+ChOfActs+%26+ABandCalledDavid+-+To+The+Bride","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f6f327cf64cfadf9b8c5b5a4b0efad9d715688c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,111,50,124,246,76,250,223,155,140,91,90,75,14,250,217,215,21,104,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
