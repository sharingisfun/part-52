Create notes and place them anywhere on your desktop. The notes will stay where you leave them until they have been closed. The notes will even reappear after rebooting your computer. You can customize your notes by choosing from a wide range of text and background colors.\n\nIf youÃ‚Â´re on the same network as other StickIt users, you can create notes on their desktops. You can send notes across other networks as well, but that requires that both StickIt users have properly opened port 1979 for UDP access.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:545143b963dac59be1ec41ff140b0c8f95cadbff","amp;dn":"StickIt+3.0.4+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"545143b963dac59be1ec41ff140b0c8f95cadbff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,81,67,185,99,218,197,155,225,236,65,255,20,11,12,143,149,202,219,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
