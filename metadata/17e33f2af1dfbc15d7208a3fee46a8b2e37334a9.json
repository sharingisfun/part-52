Alone and lost in the forest, they meet an old clairvoyant Indian that foresees their fate. Later, they are guided by the Indian The Hunter (Nathaniel Arcand) to a fort, and they seek for shelter with the men of the Northern Legion Trading Company. They note that the place is under siege of &quot;Wendigos&quot;, a sort of werewolf that has killed most of the dwellers of the place, and the survivals are very afraid. Their lives are put in danger by the deranged locals and by the surrounding beasts.\n\n\nEnjoy\n\nLGLuX\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e33f2af1dfbc15d7208a3fee46a8b2e37334a9","amp;dn":"Ginger_Snaps_3_DVDRIP_Eng-LGLuX.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e33f2af1dfbc15d7208a3fee46a8b2e37334a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,227,63,42,241,223,188,21,215,32,138,63,238,70,168,178,227,115,52,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
