It also\noffers a constantly updated support for CRW, NEF, ORF, MRW and many types of movie\nfiles. In some cases, we can even rebuild pictures that have suffered minor\ncorruptions.\n\nIf your card is damaged, corrupted, or has been formatted, PhotoRescue is the best\ndata-recovery solution you can get: it consistently beats other solutions in\nindependent tests. PhotoRescue even deals with cases where the media is NOT visible\nas a drive letter anymore. We get at the pictures other recovery software does not\neven see. Our unique unfragmenting technology rebuilds cherished memories that would\notherwise have been lost forever\n\n\nPLEASE SEED, SEED, SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7cb59892d0b39da8ebe62584a0b9f85d65ac9c7","amp;dn":"DataRescue+PhotoRescue+v3.11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7cb59892d0b39da8ebe62584a0b9f85d65ac9c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,203,89,137,45,11,57,218,142,190,98,88,74,11,159,133,214,90,201,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
