Here are the original notes:\n\nManic Street Preachers\nToothpaste N&amp;#039; Burn\n\nNIA, Birmingham\n8 December 2007\n\n\nLineage: Sony ECN-719 mic &gt; Edirol R-09 &gt; Audition (cuts, normalising, adjusting balance &amp; a little frequency adjusting to bring out the vocals - see below) &gt;FLAC level 5\n\nPosition: Block 7 row Q seated about three yards from the mixing desk.\n\nThe NIA is one of the predominant West Midlands venues in the UK but I&amp;#039;ve always thought that the sound is a bit muggy on the mid ranges. This wasn&amp;#039;t really helped by James Dean Bradfield&amp;#039;s bout of flu. Therefore using Sonic Maximiser I&amp;#039;ve tried to pull the vocals out a little bit.\n\nThe title &quot;Toothpaste N&amp;#039; Burn&quot; is a reference to Nicky Wire&amp;#039;s pain from forgetting his foundation and using toothpaste instead. What a tw@t! ;-)\n\nOther interesting bits: a part cover of &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; by The Cult &amp; about 20 seconds of Ozzy Osborne&amp;#039;s &quot;Crazy Train&quot; riff in homage to Birmingham.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Intro\n02 Motorcycle Emptiness\n03 Autumn Song\n04 Everything Must Go\n05 You Love Us\n06 Roses In The Hospital\n07 Ocean Spray\n08 Slash N&amp;#039; Burn\n09 Indian Summer\n10 She Is Suffering\n11 La Tristesse Durera (Scream To A Sigh)\n12 1985\n13 Your Love Alone Is Not Enough\n14 Kevin Carter\n15 If You Tolerate This Then Your Children Will Be Next\n16 Small Black Flowers That Grow In The Sky\n17 Everlasting\n18 Send Away The Tigers\n19 She Sells Sanctuary/Motown Junk\n20 Little Baby Nothing\n21 You Stole The Sun From My Heart\n22 Crazy Train\n23 The Masses Against The Classes\n24 A Design For Life\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAWS\n\nBTW: the MD5 file checks for both the FLAC &amp; WAV files just in case you&amp;#039;ve chosen to uncompress the FLACs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9695a85569b3fb7ad44a05189890d88dd2c1c7e","amp;dn":"Manic+Street+Preachers+-+2007-12-08+NIA%2C+Birmingham+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9695a85569b3fb7ad44a05189890d88dd2c1c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,105,90,133,86,155,63,183,173,68,160,81,137,137,13,136,221,44,28,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
