It&amp;#039;s a documetary dealing with the german invation of Crete 1941-1945. Made in 2005, it&amp;#039;s rather good.\n\nFrom the cover: &quot;Whith dramatic re-creations and over 20 veterans interviewed from Crete, England, Australia and New Zealand, including Leigh Fermor himself, The 11th Day is a heart-pounding adventure story about courage, faith and heroism... a story that is all the more remarkable because it is history&quot;\n\n\n\nTechnical info:\n\n-NTSC\n\n-Menues and quality untouched. The original contains two movie tracks (the same movie) one in english, and one in greek (not just greek audio, but the same movie with greek speaking). The greek-one have been removed, to allow 100% quality on the english one while fitted to a DVD5.\n\n-The DVD includes over 500 photos from the crete invasion 41-45.\n\n-There are no subtitles available (there was none available in the original).\n\n-All zones and copy protection removed.\n\n\n\nEnjoy, and SEED after yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8825a7aa9c479f8edef9cf666e1c1aee0777290a","amp;dn":"The+11th+Day+-+WW2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8825a7aa9c479f8edef9cf666e1c1aee0777290a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,37,167,170,156,71,159,142,222,249,207,102,110,28,26,238,7,119,41,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
