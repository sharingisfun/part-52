BloodRayne 2 challenges the supernatural anti-heroine with her most personal battle yet as she hunts down each of her wicked siblings who are carrying on the legacy of their dead father. Expanding on the predecessor, BloodRayne 2 includes new in-game dynamics such as pole combat, rail sliding and advanced melee fighting with fatality moves. Built upon a modified version of the Infernal Engine, BloodRayne 2 introduces threatening new bosses, all new environments set within a huge modern day city, a range of new supernatural powers and new motion-captured movements complete with soft-body physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6256af0e7c1f9c431afef30e4133273e2c526a1","amp;dn":"BloodRaine+2+%5B4CDs%5D%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6256af0e7c1f9c431afef30e4133273e2c526a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,37,106,240,231,193,249,196,49,175,239,48,228,19,50,115,226,197,38,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
