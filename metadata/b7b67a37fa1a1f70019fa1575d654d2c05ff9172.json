The infrastructure of the system includes RFID chips, GPS-enabled cell phones, national ID cards, and DNA databases, he explained. Jones pointed out that Tivo and Google currently monitor television and internet viewing habits, and have compiled detailed psychological profiles of the people who utilize their services.\n\nJones commented on the subprime mortgage crisis, which he believes was engineered by the Bilderbergs. He said the group planned to &quot;pop the subprime mortgage bubble&quot; in order to unravel the U.S. economy and bring down global financial markets. He also spoke about the North American Union, the Elite&amp;#039;s plan to reduce the world&amp;#039;s population to 500 million, as well as the cervical cancer vaccine, Gardasil. Jones referred to a Daily Mail article about two girls who died following their Gardasil vaccination. \n\nWriting library      : Mp3Wrap  v.  0.5\n\nAudio #0\nCodec/String         : MPEG-2 Audio layer 3\nBitRate/String       : 24 Kbps\nBitRate_Mode         : CBR\nChannel(s)/String    : 2 channels\nChannelMode          : Joint stereo\nSamplingRate/String  : 16 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7b67a37fa1a1f70019fa1575d654d2c05ff9172","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+-+Jan.+25%2C+2008+-+Alex+Jones+c2c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7b67a37fa1a1f70019fa1575d654d2c05ff9172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,182,122,55,250,26,31,112,1,159,161,87,93,101,77,44,5,255,145,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
