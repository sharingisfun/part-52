As it became clear that what reflects Evan Fairbanks&amp;#039;s &quot;airplane&quot; is indeed a car windshield, we have the ultimate proof Evan&amp;#039;s shot is 100% fake.\n\nThe ineptitude of the &quot;911 video forgery team&quot; is thus established. It may be difficult to take in that such incompetence could go unnoticed in such a well-funded military operation - but this is what we have and what emerges from the close scrutiny of their wretched false-flag operation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://livevideo.com/socialservice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://livevideo.com/socialservice&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nthanks also
