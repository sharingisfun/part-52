They have a singer that can actually sing as opposed to barking the vocals in rapid fire succession - a la nearly every thrash band in existence - and they had the least successful career out of the Big Four. Lineup changes have rendered the band nearly extinct nowadays, but they seem to be recording with their new singer.\n\nSo, this album was the first album (second if you count the EP) with Frank Bello on bass and Joey Belladonna on vocals. This album contains, arguably, Anthrax&amp;#039;s most well-known song &quot;Madhouse&quot;. The rest of the album is killer as well; &quot;A.I.R&quot; is killer opening song; &quot;S.S.C/Stand or Fall&quot; has Dan Spitz on his shreddiest (listen to that lead run after the spanish bit); and you just gotta love Joey on &quot;MEDUSAAAAAAAAAAA&quot;.\n\nThis rip is 320 kbps and got it straight of the CD.\n\nBUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE IT!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba6f6caa662f0afafa8b241686d24588fef985b4","amp;dn":"METAL+CLASSIC%3A+Anthrax+%5C%22Spreading+the+Disease%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba6f6caa662f0afafa8b241686d24588fef985b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,111,108,170,102,47,10,250,250,139,36,22,134,210,69,136,254,249,133,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
