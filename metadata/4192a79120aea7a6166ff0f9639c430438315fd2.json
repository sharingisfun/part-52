Following the landing in England of ten huge and indefatigable creatures, complete chaos erupts. Using their fiery heat rays and monstrous strength, the heartless aliens threaten the future existence of all life on earth.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4192a79120aea7a6166ff0f9639c430438315fd2","amp;dn":"%5Banti-hero%5D+H.G.+Wells+-+War+of+the+Worlds+-+64kb+-+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4192a79120aea7a6166ff0f9639c430438315fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,146,167,145,32,174,167,166,22,111,240,249,99,156,67,4,56,49,95,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
