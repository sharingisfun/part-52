The file is edited mostly in terms of the arrangement rather than the content. I split things into individual tracks, gave the album a two part structure with an &quot;intermission,&quot; and reordered things to give the tracks a sense of flow. Now it plays more like a spoken word album instead of a random bunch of recordings. I also trimmed a few bits and added some seconds of silence here and there. Raleigh purists may disagree, but I think this is much more\nenjoyable to listen to from beginning to end than &quot;Semantic Blockage&quot;.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRaleighfan\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81b13b57fb6a542d10e4f2bc26c9fdcede24be2","amp;dn":"Raleigh+Sakers+-+Transcendental+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81b13b57fb6a542d10e4f2bc26c9fdcede24be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,27,19,181,127,182,165,66,209,14,79,43,194,108,159,220,237,226,75,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
