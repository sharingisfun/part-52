Yet he feels isolated because he finds having a hard-working job and managing a family too much to handle and has no one to talk to about it. Charlie Fineman, on the other hand, doesn&amp;#039;t have a job or a family. He used to have both until he lost his family on the fateful day of 9/11, and the grief he felt caused him to quit his job and isolate himself from everyone around him. As it turns out, Alan and Charlie were roommates in college, and a chance encounter one night rekindles the friendship they shared. But when Charlie&amp;#039;s problems become too much to deal with, Alan is determined to help Charlie come out of his emotional abyss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995b664d342dfdbaee736a86ed0d9795143a47d5","amp;dn":"Reign.Over.Me.2007.PROPER.DvDRip.XviD+-+Christley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995b664d342dfdbaee736a86ed0d9795143a47d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,91,102,77,52,45,253,186,238,115,106,134,237,13,151,149,20,58,71,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
