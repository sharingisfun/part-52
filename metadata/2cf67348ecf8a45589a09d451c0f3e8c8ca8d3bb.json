The band was originally scheduled to play in Budapest this night, but instead played a second night in Poland. Only about 3,000 fans showed up to the show, causing the band to play a very intimate and spontaneous show. In an unusual move, the concert starts with four mellow songs in a row before building up to a rocking climax and then winding back down again during an eight-song encore. There is great interaction between the band and the small crowd throughout the night, and the 30-song set list is filled with less frequently played songs in the band's catalog, and all the performances are clean and tight. A special and memorable night recognized by the band and fans alike as one of the best of the year. ~ Steven Jacobetz, All Music Guide\n\nAlready published:\n\n- Ten - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3360760\n- Vs - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3361227\n- Vitalogy - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3361305\n- No Code - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3361691\n- Yield - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3361765\n- Binaural - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3361773\n- Riot Act - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3361780\n- Katowice 15.06.00 - http://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3362145\n\nWARNING!
