While the latter present limited, sanitized and artificial-looking depictions of life under the Nazi rule, Romm&amp;#039;s &quot;Ordinary Fascism&quot; pulls out all the stops in its selection of documentary material to draw the viewer not only into absolute horror about fascism and nazism in the 1920s-1940s Europe, but also to a firmest of convictions that nothing of the sort should be allowed to happen again anywhere in the world.\n\nNote the timing: the film was released in 1965, in the Soviet Union&amp;#039;s heyday at the height of the great societal and intellectual &quot;thaw&quot; that followed the Stalin&amp;#039;s death and the denunciation of Stalin&amp;#039;s totalitarianism by Nikita Khruschev. Never explicitly mentioning any of them explicitly, the film targets tyranny and despotism no matter what form they may take; the release of such a film would have been impossible under Stalin.\n\nA good indicator of the power of this film could be the fact that it is available in most video stores in Germany. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f623243c8b354815e38e095bd4dd538a963d244a","amp;dn":"%5BOrdinary+fascism%5D%5Brmvb%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f623243c8b354815e38e095bd4dd538a963d244a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,35,36,60,139,53,72,21,227,142,9,91,212,221,83,138,150,61,36,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
