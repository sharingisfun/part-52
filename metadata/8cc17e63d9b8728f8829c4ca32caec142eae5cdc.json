One of the most important &quot;krautrock&quot; groups, Can had a style grounded in the art rock of bands such as The Velvet Underground, with strong experimental and world music influences.\nDescribed by keyboard player Irmin Schmidt as an &quot;anarchist community&quot; and constructing their music largely through free improvisation and editing, which bassist Holger Czukay has referred to as &quot;instant compositions&quot;, they had only occasional commercial success, with singles such as &quot;Spoon&quot; and &quot;I Want More&quot; reaching national singles charts. However, through albums such as Tago Mago (1971) and Ege Bamyasi (1972), Can exerted a considerable influence on avant-garde, experimental, underground, ambient, New Wave and electronic music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_%28band%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_%28band%29&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc17e63d9b8728f8829c4ca32caec142eae5cdc","amp;dn":"CAN+Documentary+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc17e63d9b8728f8829c4ca32caec142eae5cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,193,126,99,217,184,114,143,136,41,196,202,50,202,236,20,46,174,92,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
