This time out it&amp;#039;s Irish sacred music, and Zazou, with the help of a small army of international stars including Egyptian percussionist Hossam Ramzy, trumpet wiz Mark Isham, and French picker extraordinaire Thierry Robin, has fashioned 13 moody settings for ancient and modern texts that feature mournful vocals by Brede Mayock and Lasairfhiona ni Chonaola. The result is new agey, but the passion of the singers and some disturbing instrumental touches keep the music from getting too predictable. The misleading ads for this album say that it features Brendan Perry from Dead Can Dance, and Katie McMahon from &quot;Riverdance.&quot; Perry does play percussion on two tracks, and McMahon sings lead on three, but if you&amp;#039;re looking for the Gothic pop of DCD or the exuberant Irish jigs of &quot;Riverdance,&quot; you&amp;#039;re going to be disappointed. --j. poet ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6c772df3554417bd47a1c98fc5500630d59b567","amp;dn":"Hector+Zazou+-+Lights+in+the+Dark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6c772df3554417bd47a1c98fc5500630d59b567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,199,114,223,53,84,65,123,212,122,28,152,252,85,0,99,13,89,181,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
