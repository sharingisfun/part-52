Stillgazer, a one man shoegazing/dream-pop/folk act, at once evokes the spirits of Kevin Shields, Hope Sandoval, and (yes) Beach House in 30 minutes of languid, reverb-laden reverie. Fans of lo-fi will no doubt appreciate the subdued tones of the debut release, but if you fancy more traditional electric shoegazing (think My Bloody Valentine, think Slowdive), you will not be dissapointed.\n\nThe six songs - five originals, one cover - vary unhurriedly, strung out like threads of water on vines of dreams. Love, lust, and the ever-changing plasma of relationships are often addressed, but, as with the best music in the genres, what is said never overshadows what is felt, and what is felt is something divine. Highlights include the &amp;#039;City Girl&amp;#039;-esque &amp;#039;What I Want&amp;#039;, the reverb-heavy &amp;#039;Future Present Past&amp;#039;, the Mazzy-Star-ish &amp;#039;Truth or Lies&amp;#039;, and the unexpectedly brilliant cover of MBV&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Sometimes&amp;#039;. That said, there is not a bad track on the debut. Stillgazer, we want more. 5/5 stars.&quot;\n\n\nArtist: Stillgazer.\nAlbum: Stillgazer EP.\nSource: CD.\nYear: 2006.\nGenre: Shoegaze/Dream-Pop.\n\nBitrate: 192kbs 44100Hz Joint Stereo.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.\tSomehow\t\t(3:36)\n2. \tWhat I Want\t(4:44)\n3.\tFuture, Present, Past\t(5:56)\n4.\tTruth or Lies\t(4:12)\n5.\tSo Easy\t(7:37)\n6.\tSometimes (4:22)\n\nTotal Playing Time: 30:27.\nTotal Size:\t41.8 MB.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38a468463ef3d28b0110e76def8040d689bcca83","amp;dn":"Stillgazer+-+Stillgazer+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38a468463ef3d28b0110e76def8040d689bcca83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,164,104,70,62,243,210,139,1,16,231,109,239,128,64,214,137,188,202,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
