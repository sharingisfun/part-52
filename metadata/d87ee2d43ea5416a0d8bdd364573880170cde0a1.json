As an analog synthesizer, TONTO was capable of creating virtually any sound. Its warm, fat bass sounds were particularly noteworthy and still cannot be recreated by the current breed of MIDI digital synthesizers and samplers.  (See more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonto's_Expanding_Head_Band)  \n\nWith Robert Margoleff, Malcolm produced two LPs - &quot;Zero Time&quot; and &quot;It's About Time&quot; - as &quot;TONTO's Expanding Head Band&quot;.  I think that &quot;Zero Time&quot; is the best.  While I have had the vinyl since forever, I was lucky and persistent enough to find a chap with a copy of the remastered compilation CD, &quot;TONTO Rides Again&quot;, and he burned me a copy.  I took this and ripped it to WAV with Winamp Pro.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d87ee2d43ea5416a0d8bdd364573880170cde0a1","amp;dn":"Tonto%5C%27s+Expanding+Head+Band+-+Tonto+Rides+Again","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d87ee2d43ea5416a0d8bdd364573880170cde0a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,126,226,212,62,165,65,106,13,139,221,54,69,115,136,1,112,205,224,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
