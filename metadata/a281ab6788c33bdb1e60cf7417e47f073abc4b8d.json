It was originally released in April 2003. It was subsequently presented in the United States as a two-part series by the Discovery Channel and its affiliates.\n\nThe documentary was produced largely by the same team who produced the award-winning documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts, though the original series&amp;#039; director, Tim Haines was not involved. In the previous documentaries, extinct animals were recreated with CGI and animatronics. For Walking with Cavemen, a slightly different approach was taken. While most of the animals depicted were still computer generated or animatronic, the human ancestors were portrayed by actors wearing makeup and prosthetics, giving them a more realistic look and permitting the actors to give the creatures a human quality.\n\nLike its predecessors, Walking with Cavemen is made in the style of a wildlife documentary, featuring a voice-over narrator (Robert Winston in the British release, Alec Baldwin in the North American release) who describes the recreations of the prehistoric past as if they are real. As with the predecessors, this approach necessitated the presentation of speculation as if it is fact, and some of the statements made about the behaviour of the creatures are more open to question than the documentary may indicate.\n\nEach species segment takes the form of a short drama featuring a group of the particular hominid in question going about their daily lives (the search for food, protecting territory, and caring for the sick and injured). The intent is to get the human viewer to feel for the creatures being examined, almost to imagine being one of them (a trait that the documentary links to the modern human brain).\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_Cavemen\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Author/Presenter - Robert Winston\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor Lord Robert Winston was born in 1940 and named Robert Maurice \nWinston.

Half a dozen or more different species of ape-men exist alongside one another. Each of them has exploited the environment in a different way and has developed their own strategy for survival.\n\n&quot;Blood Brothers&quot; follows the lives of two species, Paranthropus boisei and Homo habilis who embody two alternative ways of ape-man life. Although heavyset, with distinctive gorilla-like faces, the boisei are gentle characters. They live within a strict social structure and are led by a dominant male whose strength and power holds the group together. They are adapted brilliantly to the tough conditions in this dry arid land. Their huge teeth, four times the size of our own, and strong jaws mean they can eat the toughest vegetation. For them dried tubers and reed roots are rich pickings.\n\nThe habilis have taken a different approach to survival. They don&amp;#039;t have the specialisms of the boisei but instead have developed into the archetypal jack-of-all-trades, inquisitive scavengers prepared to try almost anything to survive. Tough, active, gregarious and noisy, they are always on the move and always alert to the possibility of a meal. They have come to use brainpower rather than brawn. They&amp;#039;ve learnt to work together to scare other predators away from food. They scavenge for meat and, perhaps most importantly, make basic stone tools - equipping themselves through their own efforts with the kind of specialist eating equipment creatures like the boisei have by nature.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a281ab6788c33bdb1e60cf7417e47f073abc4b8d","amp;dn":"BBC+Walking+With+Cavemen+2+of+4+Robert+Winston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a281ab6788c33bdb1e60cf7417e47f073abc4b8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,129,171,103,136,195,59,219,30,96,207,116,23,228,127,7,58,188,75,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
