Having got lots of positive feedback from mates who heard their tracks, the lads plumped up enough courage to send some of their quirky funk off to the newly formed, but already reputable label, Paperecordings, based in Manchester.\nWithin days of sending the tape, paper head-honcho, Elliot Eastwick was on the phone; they loved the tracks and wanted to sign them for release.\nThis was the start of an eight-year relationship with the label, which spanned numerous 12ÃƒÂ¢??, remix and album releases.\n\nHaving made an impression on the worldwide dance scene with their debut album ÃƒÂ¢??A Nice Hot Bath WithÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢??, requests started coming in for Crazy Penis live shows across Europe and the world.\n\nChris &amp; Jim knew they needed help to translate their richly orchestrated sound to the live format and so started their search for like-minded musoÃƒÂ¢??s to join the merry throng. They didnÃƒÂ¢??t have to look too farÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦..Bassist, Tim Davies (an old school-mate of JimÃƒÂ¢??s, and involved in the conception of the first Penis album) was drafted in along with ex-cream percussionist, Mav. The next member to join, vocalist (&amp; Manchester socialite) Danielle Moore was spotted by Jim doing a rousing Shirley Bassey impression at a Manchester house-party in the very early hours of the morning!!! Add a fetchingly tousled beat generator on drums by the name of Matt Klose, and The Line Up became complete.\n\n\n\nTHE SUN RISES IN THE EAST MIDLANDS...\n\nFollowing the release of the acclaimed album ÃƒÂ¢??The Wicked Is MusicÃƒÂ¢?? IN 2002, the artistes that could only be known as Crazy Penis went from strength to strength, taking their humour-filled, funk-infected Northern floorshow into the world to wow audiences from Manchester to Moscow and from Sydney to San Francisco and back. In addition, founder members Chris Todd and Jim Baron saw their remixing skills put to consistently excellent use by peer labels such as Naked Music. Not to mention Crazy Penis tracks being featured by everyone from ÃƒÂ¢??Sex &amp; The CityÃƒÂ¢?? to arthouse movies from Budapest.\n\nThen NottinghamÃƒÂ¢??s sexiest little funk number returned, all in black and ready to kick off the summer of 2004 with a big bangÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ Crazy Penis released the thrilling ÃƒÂ¢??24 Hour Psychedelic FreakoutÃƒÂ¢?? on August 2nd accompanied by a series of typically high-octane live appearances and DJ sets across Europe including The Big Chill main stage on August 1st.\n\nThe Reviewers were unanimous.\n\nÃƒÂ¢??A mesmerising listen time and time againÃƒÂ¢?? wrote the BBC website.\nÃƒÂ¢??The most exciting British Dance act since Massive AttackÃƒÂ¢?? declared DMC Update.\n\n2005 began with ÃƒÂ¢??24 Hour Psychedelic FreakoutÃƒÂ¢?? featuring in the HMV ÃƒÂ¢??Dance Albums Of The YearÃƒÂ¢?? campaign and in Album Of The Year Charts everywhere from Record Collector to IDJ. 2 Years and over 20k sales later, there is consistent demand for this album across the World from Montreal to Marrakech. Longevity: the most pertinent Proof of any Pudding.\n\nOnly last month, DFS ran a major UK TV Advertising Campaign featuring ÃƒÂ¢??The Rite PlaceÃƒÂ¢?? from the album.\n\nÃƒÂ¢??24 Hour Psychedelic FreakoutÃƒÂ¢?? represents a 60+ minute rollercoaster ride through the mixed-up world of Crazy Penis. Instinctively groovy, occasionally laid-back and always musically cool, ÃƒÂ¢??24 Hour Psychedelic FreakoutÃƒÂ¢?? is a flash-fried, new season collection of Crazy Penis tracks and exclusive Crazy Penis remixes joined at the hip by mixers du jour Chris Todd and Jim Baron.\n\nNow with their fourth album, &quot;A Night On Earth&quot;, being acclaimed as one of the Albums Of The Year by everybody from Pete Tong to Ashley Beedle to Carl Cox to Danny Howells, Crazy P are set to go bang again.\n\n\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\n1996 ÃƒÂ¢??
