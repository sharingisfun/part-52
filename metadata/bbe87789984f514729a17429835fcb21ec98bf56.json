NATURE GIRL is set in the Florida beyond Miami and Disney World, where people like Honey Santana and half-Seminole Sammy Tigertail live quiet, peculiar existences. Night telemarketer Boyd Shreave has insulted Honey with a real estate phone pitch, and she plots a bizarre revenge that brings the three characters together. Narrator Lee Adams adeptly performs the many roles in the book and makes them all seem real, though her teenager is a bit over the top in vapidness. Listeners will hate and love the appropriate people, all the time rooting for the quirky losers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbe87789984f514729a17429835fcb21ec98bf56","amp;dn":"Carl+Hiaasen+-+Nature+Girl+%28audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbe87789984f514729a17429835fcb21ec98bf56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,232,119,137,152,79,81,71,41,161,116,41,131,95,203,33,236,152,191,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
