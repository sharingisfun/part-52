Default is C:\\Program Files\\Wizet\\MapleStory. After you&amp;#039;ve erased this folder, download the .zip in this torrent. Extract the contents of this .zip file (via WinZIP or WinRAR; Google them if you don&amp;#039;t have either client... but in all honesty, you probably should) to where your Maple Story folder was originally.\n\nPROTIP: For extra assurance that this will work and not be a colossal waste of time, you should probably delete Maple Story (the client) altogether, not just the folder. Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove Programs -&gt; Maple Story -&gt; Uninstall.\n\nAlso, deleting all registry keys for Maple Story couldn&amp;#039;t really hurt (NOTICE: do not do this if you don&amp;#039;t know what you&amp;#039;re doing, and try not to delete other files by mistake. If you are in any way unsure of what you&amp;#039;re about to do, DO NOT DO IT. Either go get a trained professional, a friend/family member/neighbor with some clue, or download a Registry Cleaner or somesuch (scanning for viruses/trojans, of course).) In any event, as long as you can follow directions fine, go to Start -&gt; Run -&gt; &quot;regedit&quot; (in the RUN dialog) -&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; WIZET (delete this key).\n\nThis zip contains all the files of a completely unblemished Maple Story directory. None of the files have been touched in any way, but I encourage you to scan this and any other download for viruses before using them.\n\nAnyway, if you install this folder, your Maple Story should run just fine. In case it doesn&amp;#039;t, check your firewall settings (make sure to allow Maple Story as an exception; consult your firewall&amp;#039;s documentation if you are unsure how to do this). Oh, and for God&amp;#039;s sakes, make sure your system specifications are AT LEAST equal to the minimum specs required for the file (find them at http://maplestory.nexon.net/)\n\nALL contents of this file are Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2007 by Nexon of America, and I make no claim to them whatsoever. I am also not responsible if you somehow manage to screw up your computer (even though the installation of this is a very simple and incredibly harmless process) or are still unable to play the game after trying all the steps here described.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:416065c4cee4c655967326411c7973eba84e2f8f","amp;dn":"Maple+Story+.41","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"416065c4cee4c655967326411c7973eba84e2f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,96,101,196,206,228,198,85,150,115,38,65,28,121,115,235,168,78,47,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
