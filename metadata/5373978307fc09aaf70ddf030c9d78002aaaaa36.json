Now, this outrageous new comedy serves up this secret world for the first time on-screen. Down-and-out former professional Ping-Pong phenom Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) is sucked into this maelstrom when FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) recruits him for a secret mission. Randy is determined to bounce back and recapture his former glory, and to smoke out his father\\&amp;#039;s (Robert Patrick) killer - one of the FBI\\&amp;#039;s Most Wanted, arch-fiend Feng (Christopher Walken). But, after two decades out of the game, Randy can\\&amp;#039;t turn his life around and avenge his father\\&amp;#039;s murder without a team of his own. He calls upon the spiritual guidance of blind Ping-Pong sage and restaurateur Wong (James Hong), and the training expertise of Master Wong\\&amp;#039;s wildly sexy niece Maggie (Maggie Q), both of whom also have a dark history with Feng. All roads lead to Feng\\&amp;#039;s mysterious jungle compound and the most unique Ping-Pong tournaments ever staged. There, Randy faces such formidable players as his long-ago Olympics opponent, the still-vicious Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon). Can Randy keep his eye on the ball? Will he achieve the redemption he craves while wielding a paddle? Is his backhand strong enough to triumph over rampant wickedness?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5373978307fc09aaf70ddf030c9d78002aaaaa36","amp;dn":"Balls.Of.Fury.DVDRip.XviD.SWESUB-maz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5373978307fc09aaf70ddf030c9d78002aaaaa36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,115,151,131,7,252,9,170,247,13,223,3,12,157,120,0,42,170,170,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
