Anyone who can supply the &quot;Drums 'n' Balls (The Gancha Dub)&quot; album is most welcome. \n\nPress:\n\n&amp;raquo;Thanks for the latest K. Schulze and Wahnfried CDs. I was very pleased with these CDs. Great music, probably the best after Mirage. It is heavenly music and a pleasure to play in my radioshow. Specially the Wahnfried!!!&amp;laquo;\n(M. Vance, radio, Belgium)\n\n&amp;raquo;House of India ist eins der der sch&amp;ouml;nsten St&amp;uuml;cke, die ich seit langem geh&amp;ouml;rt habe; mit seinen leichten und langen Sequenzer-L&amp;auml;ufen erinnert es mich ein wenig an The Art of Sequencing...&amp;laquo;\n\n ... With a nice atmosphere I went into the House of India and I heard the next surprise. ... Everybody knows Klaus Schulze is behind Wahnfried. I admit the last piece is great. All the best ideas were taken from the previous tracks and played together in a soft atmosphere. It brought me almost an ecstatic quarter of an hour. It's great that I can always get it again.&amp;laquo;\n(A.
