If he survives, he can return home. If not, like a show with no audience, he&amp;#039;ll be cancelled...for good! The satellite dish Roy just bought on a free trial offer has sucked him and his wife Helen (Pam Dawber) into a hilariously bizarre teleworld. The Knables zap through episodes of Duane&amp;#039;s Underworld, HTV, Northern Overxposure, Driving Over Miss Daisy, Underworld Wrestling Foundation, the animated RoboCat (supervised by Chuck Jones) and more, all programmed by a devilish exec (Jeffrey Jones). Demonically directed by Peter Hyams (End of Days), STAY TUNED is sublime spoofery. Bet your remote control on it!\n\n\n\nRuntime: 89 min\nLanguage: English 5.1,French 5.1\nSubtitle: English,Spanish,French\n\nShouts * djfred * fadedrs * doyoufanu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18306d55fc3ef4f76fe820735c77fd6617e5702f","amp;dn":"Stay+Tuned+%281992%29+DVD-R+NTSC+WS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18306d55fc3ef4f76fe820735c77fd6617e5702f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,48,109,85,252,62,244,247,111,232,32,115,92,119,253,102,23,229,112,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
