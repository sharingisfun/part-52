The classic Rygar from the NES days is back with an adventure to save his homeland and his beloved princess from evil. However, this won't be just a nostalgic return to the 8-bit days---this new Rygar will receive a face-lift complete with majestic Greco-Roman-influenced visuals and will have a brand-new battle style using his trusty Diskarmor. Indeed, a short demo of the game shined with beautifully drawn underground caverns illuminated with slick lighting and populated with ferocious creatures. Rygar could use his Diskarmor to attack enemies many different ways, including piercing an opponent, then swinging the weapon around to destroy others in his path.\n\nRelease Date 11/26/2002\n\nhttp://ps2.gamezone.com/gamesel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef6916f8a65f93e848185e2f836c1ae97ddea768","amp;dn":"Rygar%3A+The+Legendary+Adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef6916f8a65f93e848185e2f836c1ae97ddea768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,105,22,248,166,95,147,232,72,24,94,47,131,108,26,233,125,222,167,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
