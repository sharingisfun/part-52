The videos will first of all show ingame action (frags) from the &quot;cpma done_by_Vo0&quot; movie. The other vid called &quot;ggl cpma4o4 promotion&quot; is kinda what it says; a promotion video showing of the physics in CPMA. By physics i mean how you move, jump, trick around on maps etc etc.\n\nFor those interested to try out CPMA theres a .txt file in the torrent that will explain what you need to play.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2708eb8538e7139f65ed1001952da5371ce623","amp;dn":"CPMA+%28the+next+generation+Quake%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2708eb8538e7139f65ed1001952da5371ce623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,39,8,235,133,56,231,19,159,101,237,16,1,149,45,165,55,28,230,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
