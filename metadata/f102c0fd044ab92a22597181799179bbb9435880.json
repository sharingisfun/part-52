I was sitting around tonight and got real pissed that the last episode of season 1 would'nt work. So I copied it to my HD again and it fuckin works now. The only problem is it wont play in divx, you have to use widows media player. I have no idea why (any idea's) I figured a one and a zero just got mixed up last time somewhere but I have no clue why it works now and why it only works in wmp. Any way, here it is. Sorry to those who got out of order but you gotta check out this episode.  Keep your eye out for Beecher, he is in the background alot just doing crazy things. It's great. I love OZ. Best Show ever. Someone mentioned somewhere that season 2 I think is missing the last episode and...There right. I don't have it either. Sorry people, Just watch this one twice.
