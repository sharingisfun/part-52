England is a republic, ruled by an elderly Lord Protector more interested in a mysterious comet than the long-suppressed forces of revolution fomenting in his kingdom. \nAs political factions vie for power, the travellers become embroiled in the plans of King Charles XIV who stands poised to reclaim the throne. Can they discover who is behind the drastic alteration of history or will the Puritan cause triumph throughout eternity? \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nsnatched from demonoid some time ago thanks to original uploader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8851e7ae3e738402b7ee3d6a702f8745c45d893a","amp;dn":"BBv01+-+Time+Travellers+-+Republica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8851e7ae3e738402b7ee3d6a702f8745c45d893a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,81,231,174,62,115,132,2,183,238,61,106,112,47,135,69,196,93,137,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
