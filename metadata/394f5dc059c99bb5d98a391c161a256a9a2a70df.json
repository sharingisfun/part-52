Their music is kinda slow, mellow, ballad. They're fairly popular back in the 90s though they have been releasing mini-albums lately. If anyone has other stuff from Le Couple, please post! I dearly love to have them!\n\n&quot;Not well known outside of Japan, they have an enviable reputation for creating albums without even a single bad song&quot; - one fellow's review from YesAsia.com\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSome songs were individually picked up from Kazaa (yeah, back when it was still popular) hence the inconsistent quality. If anyone has better quality version of the albums, please share as well!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:394f5dc059c99bb5d98a391c161a256a9a2a70df","amp;dn":"Le+Couple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"394f5dc059c99bb5d98a391c161a256a9a2a70df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,79,93,192,89,201,155,181,217,138,57,28,22,26,37,106,154,42,112,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
