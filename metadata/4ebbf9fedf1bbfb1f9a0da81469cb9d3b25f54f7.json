Saker som framkommer:\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Their competition uses about 50-60% of their budget on advertising.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Competitors have contacted them and want to collaborate.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ The press conference was delayed because Valdi had to go to Copenhagen and have an important meeting with UNICEF.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ The other persons in Medison are not really hired; they are just on vacation from their normal jobs in the furniture business and military.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Vista is no problem, you just need more RAM.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ There is no risk of having the same name as another multinational company according to their legal councils.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ The company doesn&amp;#039;t have any economical assets.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ The reason that they didn&amp;#039;t believe that this would become so big is because they only announced the product and website to a small local website at first.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ The reason that the project started is that their CEO didn&amp;#039;t have any income in Brazil and needed some way to gain money.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ They are still in negotiations with logistics and service organizations, even that the first computers will be delivered the coming weeks.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ VAT is supposed to be paid by Medison.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ In total contrast to what 2CO says, Medison says that they are the sellers and only using 2CO as a payment provider. They claim that contract is between the consumers and Medison Europe Limited and NOT 2CO.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ The reason they chose Fedora is that they hasnÃƒÂ¢??t looked at the alternatives and doesn&amp;#039;t know anything about them. They may change Linux distribution in the future if any company behind the distributions wants to pay for it.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Medison only have &quot;virtual offices&quot; since they are so few.\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ He is dead serious about running for prime minister. He will do this without being part of a political party and he will do this as soon as possible. It&amp;#039;s important to note that this isn&amp;#039;t an answer forced by the journalists; he talks in detail about it.\n\n\nNOTE: The sound is in Swedish! \nBTW, rekommenderar ingen att kÃƒÂ¶pa datorn...\n\nSe ÃƒÂ¤ven: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.medisonscam.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.medisonscam.info/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cint.se/debatt/ShowPostFlat.aspx?PostID=62603&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cint.se/debatt/ShowPostFlat.aspx?PostID=62603&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvnyRLpwsF4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvnyRLpwsF4&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ebbf9fedf1bbfb1f9a0da81469cb9d3b25f54f7","amp;dn":"Medison+presskonferense%2C+Stockholm+070801+%28SWEDISH%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ebbf9fedf1bbfb1f9a0da81469cb9d3b25f54f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,187,249,254,223,27,191,177,249,160,218,129,70,156,185,211,178,95,84,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
