TopStyle's editor provides user-friendly tools that aid in the creation of valid CSS, HTML, and XHTML without getting in your way. Timesaving features include the new Style Upgrade, which upgrades outdated HTML (such as font tags) to CSS with a single click. TopStyle's Style Checker checks your CSS syntax and warns of browser-related problems, while integration with CSE HTML Validator, W3C HTML Validator and HTML Tidy ensures valid HTML.\n\nTopStyle is built for professional Web authors who design standards-compliant Web sites, but its flexibility lends itself easily to nonprofessionals who wish to make the move to XHTML and CSS. What's more, TopStyle integrates with popular Web authoring tools such as Dreamweaver MX and HomeSite.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff69cd4c70f218670dbefabb4a8146926e4d6eb3","amp;dn":"TopStyle+Pro+3.10+%2B+Patch%28crack%29+from+ROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff69cd4c70f218670dbefabb4a8146926e4d6eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,105,205,76,112,242,24,103,13,190,250,187,74,129,70,146,110,77,110,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
