Hardcore, not as in countless Korn and Limp Biskit clones, but hardcore as it was meant to be--angry, fast and furious. Paying homage to Slapshot are none other than Boston&amp;#039;s best current crop of hardcore/Oi!/punk bands. This is a great tribute, something Ken Casey (bassist for the Dropkick Murphys and owner of the label that released this, Flat records) should be greatly proud of. To me, the best tracks are Blood for Blood doing &quot;No Friend of Mine&quot; The Trouble doing &quot;Back on the Map&quot;, the Molly Maguires turning &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; into a lively Irish jig and of course, the Dropkick Murphys ripping through &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Had Enough&quot;. Jack Kelly should be proud...Slapshot...an influential hardcore band that&amp;#039;s still going and the best in Boston(Or anywhere else, really) paying such a fine tribute.\n\nTrack Listing OF Boston Drops the Gloves\n\n1.\tNo Friend Of Mine - Blood For Blood\n2.\tChameleon - Tommy &amp; The Terrors\n3.\tStraight Edge In Your Face - Ten Yard Fight\n4.\tMight Make Right - Close Call\n5.\tDo What You Want - 30 Seconds Over Tokyo\n6.\tOld Tyme Hardcore - Anal Cunt\n7.\tRise And Fall - Pug Uglies\n8.\tEnforcer - Strikers\n9.\tWhat&amp;#039;s At Stake - The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\t\n10.\tWhere There&amp;#039;s Smoke - Vigilantes\n11.\tStep On It - Intent To Injure\n12.\tI Want You Dead - Kicked In The Head\n13.\tBack On The Map - Trouble\n14.\tSomething To Prove - Wrong Side Of The S\t\n15.\tIt&amp;#039;s Happening Today - Pinkerton Thugs\t\n16.\tJohnny Was - Black List\n17.\tNo Guts No Glory - Last In Line\t\n18.\tHang Up Your Boots - Grenades\t\n19.\tNo Time Left - Nobody&amp;#039;s Heroes\t\n20.\tSecrets - Down But Not Out\t\n21.\tMoment Of Truth - Molly Maguires\n22.\tI&amp;#039;ve Had Enough - Dropkick Murphys\n\n\n&amp;#039;Fight the world, not each other&amp;#039; CD\nA compilation tribute to 7 seconds \n\nHere is a fairly recent list of the bands and songs for the 7 Seconds comp:\n\n1.Good Clean Fun - Bully\n4.Committed for life\n5.Reinforce - Satyagraha\n6.Up Front - Still Believe\n7.Better than a thousand - In your face\n8.Guiding Line - New Wind\n9.Veil - Busy Little people OR help me scream\n10.97a - Fuck your amerikkka\n11.H20 - Not just boys fun\n12.Morning Before - Weak Link\n15.Time Flies - Here&amp;#039;s your warning\n17.Insist - We&amp;#039;re gonna fight OR Regress no way\n18.Real - Walk together, Rock together\n\n\nAnd to Sick Of It All &amp;#039;Our Impact Will Be Felt&amp;#039;\nTracklist\n\n01.Rise Against - Built to Last 01:57\n02.Unearth - Clobberin Time/What&amp;#039;s Going On 03:13\n03.Hatebreed - Ratpack 00:50\n04.Madball - Give Respect 01:19\n05.Bleeding Through - The Truth 02:52\n06.Comeback Kid - Step Down 03:01\n07.Ignite - Cease Fire 02:37\n08.The Bouncing Souls - Good Lookin&amp;#039; Out 02:06\n09.Pennywise - My Life 01:03\n10.Kill Your Idols - Friends Like You 01:10\n11.Sepultura - Scratch the Surface 02:36\n12.Himsa - Maladjusted 02:30\n13.Most Precious Blood - Alone 02:33\n14.First Blood - Just Look Around 02:50\n15.Stretch Armstrong - Busted 01:48\n16.Walls of Jericho - Us Vs.
