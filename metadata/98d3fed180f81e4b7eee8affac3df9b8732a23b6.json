Bahzell is a prince of the Hradni, an outsize humanoid race prone to berserk rages. Due to a variety of circumstances, he becomes obliged to flee into regular humans&amp;#039; lands where Hradni are understandably unpopular. He and his companion survive a series of briskly paced adventures in a world Weber builds with a nice eye for detail, above-average knowledge of history, and a pleasing amount of wit. Moreover, the book&amp;#039;s ending neither requires nor precludes a sequel. At the moment, Weber is not on a course to high honors or academic reputation but rather is emerging as a consistent producer of highly entertaining and intelligent action tales.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d3fed180f81e4b7eee8affac3df9b8732a23b6","amp;dn":"David+Weber+-+Oath+of+Swords+-+Upped+by+Lunan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d3fed180f81e4b7eee8affac3df9b8732a23b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,211,254,209,128,248,30,75,126,238,138,255,172,61,249,184,115,42,35,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
