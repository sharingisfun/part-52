Since first taking the stage in 2002, they have honed their mixture of crushing intensity, haunting melodies, and irresistible beats seamlessly into a surprisingly accessible hybrid, proven time and again to not only attract crowds, but to get crowds moving.\n\nRemaining independent since its inception, Many Machines on Nine (featuring drummer Ben Ellingworth, bassist Luke Ford, guitarist Kerry Foulke, and singer/programmer/producer Daniel Sutherland) has relied on hard work, mesmerizingly energetic live shows, polished, professional quality (self-produced) recordings, and above all, strong, hook-laden songs to create a groundswell of support that has cemented their reputation as one of AustraliaÃƒÂ¢??s most respected bands.\n\nAs well as touring around the country headlining their own shows, and supporting some of AustraliaÃƒÂ¢??s premier acts (such as The Butterfly Effect and Cog), Many Machines on Nine have also shared the stage with major international artists such as Static X, Ill Nino, and Dry Kill Logic, and have played to crowds of over 10.000 at two of Macquarie UniversityÃƒÂ¢??s Conception Day Festivals.\n\nBut rather than be content with winning over traditional live music fans, in November of 2006 Many Machines on Nine remixed and revamped their sound and took the stage at an underground dance party (Hard Wars Indoors) to perform a live set alongside world-renowned DJs Scott Brown and DJ Neophyte, in front of 3,000 glow-stick wielding ravers. The overwhelmingly positive response of the crowd goes a long way toward explaining why Many Machines on Nine were invited to perform on national television at the 2006 MusicOz Awards (the Australian music industryÃƒÂ¢??s night of nights for unsigned artists), where they were nominated for Best Hardcore/Metal Act, Best Dance/Electronic Act, and Best Video, not to mention Artist of the Year.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/manymachinesonnine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/manymachinesonnine&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36a9a550fcc3ffb8cb29e4529c0c565b1e182e79","amp;dn":"Many+machines+on+nine+-+many+machines+on+nine+byMerdok%28ozm%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36a9a550fcc3ffb8cb29e4529c0c565b1e182e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,169,165,80,252,195,255,184,203,41,228,82,156,12,86,91,30,24,46,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
