Advanced\nyet intuitive features like multi-moderation allow you to focus on developing\nyour community, rather than wrestling with complex settings.\n\nNOTE: You probably saw this release by LOGiC earlier this day:\nInvision.Power.Board.v2.0.4.PHP.NULL-LOGiC\nThis release is based on a stolen web-release called:\nIPB.2.0.4.nulled.by.Tails.w********ce.net\nThe included nfo says:\n[cut]\nThis copy of Invision Power Board 2.0.4 has been nulled by Tails (aka mjalan)\nfrom w********ce.net\n\nProtection removed: Version Checking\nOther notes: I have changed the version from 2.0.4 to 2.0.0(Trial) so that\npeople in IPB still thinks u r using legal version.. :) but dun worry, it is\nstill version 2.0.4\n[/cut]\nLOGiC just changed the version back to 2.0.4 and removed some Hotlinks, License\nInfo and included their serial (info.txt). Read about this horrible security \nrisk later.\nBut they made some mistakes:\n/upload/retail/regkey.php\n&lt;?php\n$customer_reg_key = '1114318800-24407-171-44844-LIFE';\n$customer_copy_key = '';\n?&gt;\nThey left the key from the web-release there.\n\nThe idea of the web-release was to let the 2.0.4 look like a Trial version - so\nthey added a &quot;(Trial)&quot; in the copyright tag. LOGiC also have this tag in their\nrelease and it is NOT included in the non-Trial version (yeah, we even have a\nlegit source!). Here are the proofs:\nuploadsourcesadminadmin_skin.php (line 1050)\n\n&lt;div class='copy' align='center'&gt;Powered by Invision Power Board(Trial) &amp;copy &quot;.date(&quot;Y&quot;).&quot; IPS, Inc.&lt;/div&gt;\n\nuploadskin_cachecacheid_2\nThis folder would only be created if you run it on a webserver and it is only\nincluded in the web and LOGiC release - it is NOT included in the fresh legit\nversion you can get from the developer because it was never installed before.\n\nuploadstyle_imagescss_2.css\nThis file would be created too if you run it on a webserver - there is also a\nmessage in line 7:\n/* CACHE FILE: Generated: Thu, 05 May 2005 16:42:07 GMT */\nthis file either only is included in the web and LOGiC release!\n\nNow lets get to the important point:\nThe developers IPS included a lic check function so they can check every online\nInvision Power Board if it has a valid license by adding this:\n?ipscheck=1 (example: http://www.domain.com/forum/?ipscheck=1)\nIf you use this on the LOGiC release you get this:\n0000000000-0000-000-00000-REGD\nIf you use it on a legit forum you get a 10 digits number like on:\nhttp://www.winfuture-forum.de/?ipscheck=1 you get this:\n14857,26160\nSo IPS can easily get you if they see you use the LOGiC serial.\n\nWe bring you a Incl.Keygen Release which automatically generates a key and\nincludes it in your Invision Power Board - no activation in the Admin CP\nneeded.\n\n                    _________...   . ..._________            \n   ___ _ __ ______________________x\\.
