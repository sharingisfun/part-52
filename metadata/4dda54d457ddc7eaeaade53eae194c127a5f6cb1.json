He isn&amp;#039;t. That doesn&amp;#039;t stop him from embarrassing himself in front of the cameras on a regular basis, whether from his political sermonizing, his stand-up &amp;#039;comedy&amp;#039;, or his incredibly unique dancing. Meanwhile, long-suffering Tim longs after Dawn the engaged receptionist and keeps himself sane by playing childish practical jokes on his insufferable, army-obsessed deskmate Gareth. Will the Slough office be closed? Will the BBC give David a game show? Will Tim and Dawn end up with each other? And more importantly, will Gareth realize what a hopeless prat he is?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dda54d457ddc7eaeaade53eae194c127a5f6cb1","amp;dn":"The+Office+DVD1%2F2+-+%5BSQT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dda54d457ddc7eaeaade53eae194c127a5f6cb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,218,84,212,87,221,199,234,234,173,229,62,174,25,76,18,122,95,108,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
