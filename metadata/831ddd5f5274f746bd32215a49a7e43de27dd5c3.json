Notably the &quot;park theme&quot; is different to the one used in the album version, though the album version of the park theme can be heard on this demo tape.\n\nIn August 2007, this album was reissued on the TDRS Music label. It is available in a limited edition version, personalized by Buckethead, and a regular edition, which is not personalized, but has complete artwork, which the limited edition versions lacks.\n\n\nUnofficial Track listing\n\nEven though the demo tape is one continuous track fans have split it into 23 &quot;parts&quot;. The re-release version comes as a 57 track version.\n\n1. &quot;Blueprints Theme&quot; - 2:24\n2. &quot;Giant Robot VS Cleopat&quot; - 6:46\n3. &quot;Wonka in Slaughter Zone&quot; - 1:55\n4. &quot;Gorey Head Stump &amp; Nosin&amp;#039;&quot; - 1:24\n5. &quot;Computer Master&quot; - 1:34\n6. &quot;Chicken for Lunch&quot; - 1:30\n7. &quot;Sterling Scapula&quot; - 1:35\n8. &quot;Seaside&quot; - 2:51\n9. &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Go to Wally World&quot; - 4:36\n10. &quot;Robot Flight&quot; - 2:20\n11. &quot;Earthling Fools&quot; - 2:37\n12. &quot;Guts &amp; Eyeballs&quot; - 0:57\n13. &quot;Haunted Farm&quot; - 3:11\n14. &quot;The Rack &amp; Alice in Slaughterland&quot; - 2:34\n15. &quot;Skids Looking Where&quot; - 3:12\n16. &quot;Buddy on a Slab &amp; Funeral Time&quot; - 2:09\n17. &quot;Decapitation&quot; - 4:18\n18. &quot;Virtual Reality [2nd Version]&quot; - 1:24\n19. &quot;Giant Robot Finale&quot; - 0:41\n20. &quot;Robotic Chickens&quot; - 1:54\n21. &quot;Intro to Bucketheadland Park [Theme]&quot; - 4:26\n22. &quot;Swamp Boy Square Dance&quot; - 5:04\n23. &quot;Pirate&amp;#039;s Life for Me&quot; - 1:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:831ddd5f5274f746bd32215a49a7e43de27dd5c3","amp;dn":"Buckethead%2F+Bucketheadland+Blueprints","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"831ddd5f5274f746bd32215a49a7e43de27dd5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,29,221,95,82,116,247,70,189,50,33,90,73,167,228,61,226,125,213,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
