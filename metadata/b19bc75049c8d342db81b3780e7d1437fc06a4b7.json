AMAZING gig, shn so be patient. From guthlac2\nRobert Wyatt 1974-09-08 Drury Lane Theatre Royal London England (T-399)\n\nThis CD-r release was made mostly from a reel to reel tape recorded at 3 3/4 ips that I got in trade about 1975 or 1976.  I also used a cassette tape I got in trade in the early 90's to fill in the missing songs.  This has been one of my favorite shows since I first heard it.  I've listened to other versions that are available and this one sounds better and it is complete.  Other versions usually are missing the Julie Tippett songs and the stage announcements.  The artwork is from scans of a Xerox of the programme for that night.\n\nMics and recorder unknown &gt;\nReel to reel tape 3 3/4 ips and cassette &gt;\nPlayback Decks: Akai GX-747 &amp; Tascam 130 &gt;\nNikko 32 Band EQ &gt;\nAkai DR16 Digital Hard Disk Recorder &gt;\nSony PCM-R500 DAT Recorder &gt;\nSony DAT Tape &gt;\nHHB CDR-800 Compact Disc Recorder &gt;\nHHB CDR &gt;\nWAV &gt; SHN\n\ndisc 1\n\n1.
