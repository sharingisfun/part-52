Later, the catastrophe was called ÃƒÂ¢??Hammer of EdenÃƒÂ¢??. 14 years had passed since then, on the ruined lands people made a New United Nations, and theyÃƒÂ¢??re pursuing the peace. \nYabitsu was a town where the tsunami had brought a nuclear carrier. This town was prospered by the energy from the nuclear generator of the carrier. Keel, a boy living in this town, didnÃƒÂ¢??t have any relatives. His mother-in-law, Aoi, was secretary general of New United Nations. She thought of the catastrophe as the best opportunity for human races, and she was making efforts to make a new world in which people could help each other overcoming differences of races, ideologies, and religions. However, each nationÃƒÂ¢??s ego was uglier than before the catastrophe. \n\nA military officer, Gould, had helped her to rebuild the world. However, he was disappointed in the human races. He thought military power was the only way to make an order. Then, he carried out a coup dÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tat using Ulysses, a strategic nuclear submarine, and he declared war against New United Nation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf126fdb8aca6ab378a0fa7a1bde283eb306f3af","amp;dn":"Tide-Line+Blue+%5BDVD+H264+AAC%5D+%5BKyozoku%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf126fdb8aca6ab378a0fa7a1bde283eb306f3af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,18,111,219,138,202,106,179,120,160,250,122,27,222,40,62,179,6,243,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
