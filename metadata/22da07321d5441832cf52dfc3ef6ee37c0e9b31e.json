Lacking the source code to the extant programs, I can only offer this output of my own efforts.\n\nTo actualize fair use rights with the new IBX, first run &amp;#039;mirakagi&amp;#039; which will enter the IBX keys into the FairUse4WM blackbox-keys.txt text file.\nNext, you should use the attached version of FairUse4WM, 1.3Fix-2. This includes an important fix for a video corruption bug, often seen in scenes affording high compression.\n\nIf problems occur, please provide the program text. IBX versions after 11.0.6000.6324 are not currently supported.\n\nThis version should be capable of interfacing with both Windows Vista and Zune software versions.&quot;\n\nSee also http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=127943\nApparently this file is illegal, so don&amp;#039;t tell anyone! ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22da07321d5441832cf52dfc3ef6ee37c0e9b31e","amp;dn":"Mirakagi+WM-DRM+Removal+Tool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22da07321d5441832cf52dfc3ef6ee37c0e9b31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,218,7,50,29,84,65,131,44,245,45,252,62,246,238,55,192,233,179,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
