A compelling story drives the player\n  through huge lushly detailed 3D environments and challenges their game\n  play skills in combat, puzzle solving, stealth and exploration. With\n  each success, the player achieves new dark powers that will grant Kain\n  the ability to access treacherous new areas to explore and the power\n  to face stronger, more aggressive enemies. As the player develops a\n  stronger, more skilled vampire, they are rewarded with dozens of\n  dazzling in-game cinematic sequences that unfold the continuing epic\n  of Nosgoth, and Kain&amp;acute;s attempts to ultimately rule over it. \n\n  * You are the vampire Kain - the most evil figure to grace a video\n    game console. \n\n  * Move through crowds unseen cloaked in stealth, travel stories above\n    the peasant herds on which you feed leaping from roof-top to\n    roof-top, and use mind-control on hapless fools to help you\n    overcome vampire-proof inventions. \n\n  * Combat choreography unfolds with dance-like precision as Kain\n    engages armies of demons and humans alike. \n\n  * The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and\n    special moves will satiate even the hardened of fighting game fans. \n\n  * The most beautiful graphics seen on a console to date! The world\n    that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed, blood-chilling gothic\n    environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive\n    with the soon to be dead. \n\n  * With intuitive AI behavioral response, watch peasants and enemy\n    characters flee, call to arms or remain unaware as Kain moves\n    stealthily through crowds or charges sword raised into open areas. \n\n  * The combination of a dynamic action game with the dark mood and\n    atmosphere make for an intense and cinematic gaming experience. \n\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &quot;MODE1/2048&quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.\n\n  This game also used the new Xbox libraries and had a media check,\n  this release has been cracked and tested on a developer XBOX.\n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X-\n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  /\n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    /\n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     /\n                              ___/              /        _ _\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e412d36c9d363bb2ba3bb566e46a13e59810b6b","amp;dn":"Blood+Omen+2+XBOX+-+ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e412d36c9d363bb2ba3bb566e46a13e59810b6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,65,45,54,201,211,99,187,43,163,187,86,110,70,161,62,89,129,11,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
