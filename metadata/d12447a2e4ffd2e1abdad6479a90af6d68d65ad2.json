I&amp;#039;ve had this idea about just sitting on the porch or in my living room, playing music with my friends and putting it up on the Internet.&quot;\n\nAnd that was how Daryl Hall came up with the idea of Live from Daryl&amp;#039;s House, a monthly Internet webcast featuring him playing along with some of his friends and colleagues in an intimate setting.\n\nAmong the guests scheduled to stop by as Daryl debuts some of his new songs are Matchbox Twenty&amp;#039;s Rob Thomas, Gym Class Heroes&amp;#039; Travis McCoy, Flight of the Conchords&amp;#039; Bret and Jemaine as well as partner John Oates and longtime band member T-Bone Wolk.\n\n&quot;I&amp;#039;ve always thought live performances were the only way to communicate directly with your fans,&quot; said Daryl of the show&amp;#039;s format, which he compares to an Internet version of the hit U.K. TV show Later with Jools Holland.\n\n&quot;This is straight from me to the audience. It gives me the freedom to allow a glimpse into my creative process and work with different musicians. And I feel more comfortable doing it this way. The Internet is a refreshing opportunity to reach people.&quot;\n\nDaryl explains the show could take place in any number of locations, including one of his three homes in upstate New York, Bahamas and London, a recording studio, a front porch or wherever he happens to be.\n\nNote:\nIf you have problems playing this file, VLC Player will play .flv (Flash Video) files http://www.videolan.org/vlc/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d12447a2e4ffd2e1abdad6479a90af6d68d65ad2","amp;dn":"Daryl+Hall+-Live+from+Daryl%5C%27s+House+Part+1.WebRip.%5BPSoul%5D.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d12447a2e4ffd2e1abdad6479a90af6d68d65ad2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,36,71,162,228,255,210,225,171,218,214,71,154,144,175,109,104,214,90,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
