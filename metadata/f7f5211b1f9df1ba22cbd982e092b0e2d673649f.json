BDO 2000 interview footage-\n\t\tChannel V special that contains shortish portions of TR's interview with Jabba, and some funny quotes and comments by some Aussie bands that were on the bill about their rememberances of NIN. \n\t\t5 minutes.\n\n\t2. TR excerpts from the Johnny Cash tribute show-\n\t\tPretty old now, but i had a few requests for this to be added to the next interviews collection. \n\t\tFor shits and giggles i included the STUNNING Sheryl Crow version of Hurt...BWAHAHAHAHA! \n\t\t10 minutes\n\n\t3. Summersonic Festival Japan 2005 interviews/clips-\n\t\tNice little special, 3 sets of interviews and clips. \n\t\tFeatures the only non web-streamed pro shot clips of ENTIRE songs from the 2005 tour (Head like a hole, Pinion, Wish and Hurt ) \n\t\t30 minutes\n\n\t4. Australian 'Rage' tv special from 2000-\n\t\tTR introducing his fav clips and discussing some of his influences. \n\t\tThe clips themselves are not included. \n\t\tA few people emailed and pm'd me requesting this, so i chucked it on, even though it's already on an earlier compilation i put out. \n\t\tAdded at the last minute, not the greatest quality, but best i could find. \n\t\t*DISCLAIMER- Yes, he talks extensively about Public Enemy and A Tribe Called Quest, but this DOES NOT mean the new album will be hip hop!!!*...\n\t\t20 minutes.\n\n\t5. Extra - 'Light Of Day' footage-\n\t\tTR's infamous scenes from the movie. \n\t\tAgain, very old, but requested by some newer fans. \n\t\t5 minutes.\n\n\t6. Extra - Eraser/Hurt screen projection footage from SD tour-\n\t\tFor those that weren't around at the time, in mid 2005 our friend Jose (aka Itouchedtrent_reznor, customersarefirst, etc) put his copy of these up for sale for a ridiculous amount on Ebay. \n\t\tI'd had these for a few years and sat on 'em, but released them for free when he started that crap. \n\t\tHis copy had crappy audio, this copy has been resynced using the audio of TDS special edition \n\t\tAs requested.\n\t\t10 minutes\n\n\t7. Extra - Dallas 1990 pro shot show-\n\t\tThe same show currently on Youtube, renamed &quot;hate 1990&quot;\n\t\tAs requested.\n\t\t40 minutes.\n\n\t8. Extra - Mr Self Destruct live clip 1994 -\n\t\tFor some reason, a lot of you have been asking for live clips of MSD, so here's my fav from Nashville 1994.\n&quot;\n\neatyourblud thanks nympholept, Slaytez, Gayo, It'sjustdave, Devon, bmoloney, bradmf and ninefootnails","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f5211b1f9df1ba22cbd982e092b0e2d673649f","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+The+Interview+Essentials+Vol+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f5211b1f9df1ba22cbd982e092b0e2d673649f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,245,33,27,31,157,241,186,34,203,217,130,224,146,176,226,214,115,100,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
