This is Dave King at his best, and Eddie Clark brings sharp and emotional axework to the table as well.\nThe title track stands out with a strong chorus, a forte which is later repeated in &quot;Hold On To the Night&quot;.\nThe backbeat and solid chord drive fuel top rocker &quot;After Midnight,&quot; and the hallowed vocals make both the verses and chorus among the elite in the band&amp;#039;s reportoire.\nThe slow-to-heavy shifts in &quot;If You Could See&quot; give great mood, while the yearning verses in &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Stop the Fight&quot; stand tall. &quot;Get Tough&quot;, as well, is especially driving.\nPossibly my all-time favorite Fastway cut is &quot;Stand Up,&quot; which, while a bit slower paced, is pure atmospheric power. Vocal-driven, bottom-heavy, and powerfully rhythmic.\nThis soundtrack has become a bit tough to find, but if you see it, grab it.\n[www.metal-reviews.com]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3456d35ea6438236baf318beeb7c58d4a7540a1","amp;dn":"Soundtrack+-+Trick+Or+Treat+%28Fastway%29+%5B%40320k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3456d35ea6438236baf318beeb7c58d4a7540a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,69,109,53,234,100,56,35,107,175,49,139,238,183,197,141,74,117,64,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
