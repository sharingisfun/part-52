They have recorded two acclaimed demos and one album, A Sceptic&amp;#039;s Universe, since they began in 1993, as well as a Fates Warning cover &quot;A Prelude To Ruin&quot; for the tribute album Through Different Eyes - A Tribute to Fates Warning.\n\nA Sceptic&amp;#039;s Universe is the first and as of 2007 only full length studio album released by Spiral Architect, a Norwegian technical metal band. The album is known for its dizzying and varied time signatures, as well as for singer ?yvind HÃƒÂ¦geland&amp;#039;s unique style of wailing clean vocals. The album is also characterized by a thin lead guitar sound, which further complements the upfront sound of the bass.\n\n   1. &quot;Spinning&quot; ? 3:23\n   2. &quot;Excessit&quot; ? 6:13\n   3. &quot;Moving Spirit&quot; ? 3:44\n   4. &quot;Occam&amp;#039;s Razor&quot; ? 1:32\n   5. &quot;Insect&quot; ? 5:54\n   6. &quot;Cloud Constructor&quot; ? 5:25\n   7. &quot;Conjuring Collapse&quot; ? 6:30\n   8. &quot;Adaptability&quot; ? 4:34\n   9. &quot;Fountainhead&quot; ? 6:30\n\n\nBrought to you by QFU D(os).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90c76528dfee885232390f33b1cd0bbd574a5f43","amp;dn":"Spiral+Architect+-+A+Skeptic%5C%27s+Universe+%5BMp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90c76528dfee885232390f33b1cd0bbd574a5f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,199,101,40,223,238,136,82,50,57,15,51,177,205,11,189,87,74,95,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
