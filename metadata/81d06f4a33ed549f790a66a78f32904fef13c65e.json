However this is pretty decent quality, and was found on the Internet Archive.  If you don`t want to take up a full 4GB of hard disk space this torrent will do just fine.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430484/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430484/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Power of Nightmares is a documentary that describes how, around the same time, two ways of thinking about the world formed, one radical islam, in the way of Sayyed Qutb, the other, strauss\\\\\\&amp;#039; neoconervativism.  It includes references to 9/11, and other important historical events.  The film attempts to portray the two ideologies as competing interests, that are very similar in aim, history, and in substance.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.medialens.org/alerts/04/041118_Power_Of_Nightmares_1.HTM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.medialens.org/alerts/04/041118_Power_Of_Nightmares_1.HTM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://medialens.org/alerts/04/041119_Power_Of_Nightmares_2.HTM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://medialens.org/alerts/04/041119_Power_Of_Nightmares_2.HTM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt\\\\\\&amp;#039;s not perfect, however, and there are gaping holes in it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s interpretation of history.
