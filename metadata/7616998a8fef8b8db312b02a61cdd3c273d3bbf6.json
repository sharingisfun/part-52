Dubbed the &quot;Growing Up Live&quot; tour, the name proved to be prophetic, as Gabriel&amp;#039;s 28-year-old daughter Anna tagged along with camera in hand to document her father&amp;#039;s personal life on the road. The resulting documentary, GROWING UP ON TOUR: A FAMILY PORTRAIT, offers an intimate snapshot of Gabriel&amp;#039;s struggle to balance the demands of touring with his familial obligations to his two grown-up daughters and new wife and baby, all of whom joined him on the road. Interspersing live performance footage and candid interviews with the Gabriel clan, Anna&amp;#039;s film offers a unique perspective on the modern-day tug-of-war between career and family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7616998a8fef8b8db312b02a61cdd3c273d3bbf6","amp;dn":"Peter+Gabriel%2C+Growing+up+on+tour%2C+A+family+portrait","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7616998a8fef8b8db312b02a61cdd3c273d3bbf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,22,153,138,143,239,139,141,179,18,176,42,97,205,211,194,115,211,187,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
