It is a comedy film which has the tagline: &quot;Two sisters will do anything to hook the right man.&quot;\n\nThere are not many characters in Love Serenade, which is set in an almost-deserted outback town called Sunray. We&amp;#039;re introduced to a pair of sisters, Dimity (Miranda Otto) and Vicki-Ann (Rebecca Firth), who share a house. Dimity, the shy and insecure sibling, is a waitress at a local Chinese restaurant. Vicki-Ann, the brash one, is a hair stylist. Both are looking for love, although the prospects in Sunray seem bleak, at best. That is, until Ken Sherry (George Shetsov) moves into the house next door.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd6830ad5fd34c779a3b1a0be06d1d903307374","amp;dn":"Love.Serenade.1996.DVDrip.English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd6830ad5fd34c779a3b1a0be06d1d903307374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,214,131,10,213,253,52,199,121,163,177,160,190,6,209,217,3,48,115,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
