The pilots there deliver mail over a dangerous and usually foggy mountain pass. Geoff Carter, the lead flyer, seems distant and cold as Bonnie tries to get closer to him. Things heat up as Judy MacPherson, Geoff\\&amp;#039;s old flame, shows up with her husband who is an infamous pilot.\n\nTrivia:\nHoward Hawks remembers: \\&quot;[When the movie was released] a certain critic said \\&amp;#039;It\\&amp;#039;s the only picture Hawks ever made that didn\\&amp;#039;t have any truth in it.\\&amp;#039; I wrote him a letter and said, \\&amp;#039;Every blooming thing in that movie was true.\\&amp;#039; I knew the men that were in it and everything about it.
