He&amp;#039;s a huge Page fan and explained that this \nLP had never been officially released on CD. His LP was in very nice condition so \nI agreed to help him out.\n\nAfter completing the transfer and returning my friend&amp;#039;s LP I pretty much just forgot\nabout it, leaving the audio and artwork sitting in the far corner of my hard drive.\n\n\nWhile this LP is not something I would typically have in rotation on my playlist, \nI&amp;#039;m thinking that there may be some other Led Zeppelin-Jimmy Page fans who might \nenjoy having access to it.\n\nThis LP was transferred, using my usual mid-fi setup at 44.1kHz/16-bit \n(so there will not be a 24-bit version available).The vinyl pops and clicks have \nbeen removed manually using Adobe Audition.\n\nI have taken the finished wav files and converted them to flac for this torrent.\nThe artwork from the LP is also included.\n\nThe track listing is as follows:\n\nTrack 1: Who&amp;#039;s To Blame\nTrack 2: The Chase\nTrack 3: City Sirens\nTrack 4: Jam Sandwich\nTrack 5: Carole&amp;#039;s Theme\nTrack 6: The Release\nTrack 7: Hotel Rats And Photostats\nTrack 8: Shadow In The City\nTrack 9: Jill&amp;#039;s Theme\nTrack 10: Prelude\nTrack 11: Big Band, Sax, And Violence\nTrack 12: Hypnotizing Ways (Oh Mamma)\n\nSo to those Led Zep-Jimmy Page fans who gotta have it all- this one&amp;#039;s for you.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n-DLedin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b1b2d49befa01d3180794556d9b20d93b9785e","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Page%2C+Death+Wish+II-+Original+Soundtrack+vinyl+transfer%2C+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11b1b2d49befa01d3180794556d9b20d93b9785e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,177,178,212,155,239,160,29,49,128,121,69,86,217,178,13,147,185,120,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
