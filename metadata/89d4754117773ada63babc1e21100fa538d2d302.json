(Requires an Orange Box game to play) Players suit up in the Valkyrie suit, equipped with a powerful arm cannon integrated into the suit and the ability to morph into a sphere for faster mobility and different attack capabilities. Previously titled Three Month Mod, it was thus named for the amount of time it had taken us on the project. Three months from conception to release.
