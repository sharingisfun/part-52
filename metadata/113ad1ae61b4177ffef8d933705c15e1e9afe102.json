It can bring us the physical experience of war, \nwith all its horrors, like no other medium. And yet the image of \nAmerican war on television is increasingly disembodied, bloodless, \nand unreal. This film traces the development of the image of war on \nAmerican television from Vietnam to the present day to understand \nwhy we see what we see when we look at war on television. It tells \nthe story of how the perception of war has become as important as \nwar itself. And it asks how democracy can be served if citizens are \ndenied a true understanding of the daily consequences of the wars \ntheir nations fight. \n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Enemy Image - US War Reporting (2005-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 699 MB (or 716,496 KB or 733,691,904 bytes)\nFrames.......: 576x432 (1.33:1) [=4:3] @ 0.166 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1035 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113ad1ae61b4177ffef8d933705c15e1e9afe102","amp;dn":"Enemy+Image+-+US+War+Reporting+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113ad1ae61b4177ffef8d933705c15e1e9afe102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,58,209,174,97,180,23,127,254,248,217,51,112,92,21,225,233,175,225,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
