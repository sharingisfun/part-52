Fronted by brothers Martin and Richard Williams, the band began gigging around their native Colchester and soon earned favourable comparisons to Idlewild, Radiohead and Pavement. \nAfter a few ventures to London, the fledgling Absent Kid would soon get their first break after winning the Diesel U-Music Award for Best New Rock act. Some NME coverage later and the band were soon releasing debut mini-album ?I Burnt Down the Family Business? through legendary North London indie label Fierce Panda. They began playing gigs with the likes of The Subways, Art Brut, Kasabian and Queen Adreena and featured on both MTV2 and Radio One, as well as recording a session for XFM. \nThe new album ?MISADVENTURE? is the bands finest work to date, a classic indie-rock album with a triumphant outlook brimming with catchy hooks, jerky spazz-rock grooves and punch the air moments! \n\n\n __ __________                    ______________________________________________________\n\\ \\________//------------------\\___________________________________________________//\n\n\n        ..\n        :: Release Info:\n        ::\n        :: Artist......&gt; Absent Kid\n        :: Title.......&gt; Misadventure\n        :: Label.......&gt; Independant\n        :: Genre.......&gt; Indie\n        :: Rip.Date....&gt; 00.00.2008\n        :: Street.Date.&gt; 00.00.0000\n        :: Source......&gt; CDDA\n        :: Quality.....&gt; VBR / avg. 206kbps / 44,1kHz / Joint-Stereo\n        :: Encoder.....&gt; LAME 3.97/V2/VBRNEW\n        :: URL.........&gt; Http://www.absentkid.co.uk\n\n\n __ __________                    _______________________________________________________\n\\ \\________//------------------\\____________________________________________________//\n\n        ..\n        :: Track Listing:\n        ::\n        :: 01.
