Cavern of Tile (32:32)\n\n\nCombining phonography and longform ambient genres seemed like a good idea, and I especially wanted to work from a piece I did with Stephen Philips, &quot;Texture One&quot; (2005, Webbed Hand Records). Namely, I wanted to use glurp sounds, or sounds created by water.\n\nAll of the many sounds in this longform piece are 100 percent harvested and created at my apartment. One of the predominant sounds is actually a brewing device malfunctioning. I promise that none of the sounds involve my urinating-- they are all sinks, faucets, pipes, and so on.\n\nThe result, much for you to judge, for my part is a successful longform piece evocative of water and urban environments like the one that was its source.\n\nThanks again to Sandy Spreitz for great cover art ( www.sandystudio.com ).\n\n\n\nDiscogs link: http://www.discogs.com/release/1214167\nInternet Archive link: http://www.archive.org/details/Cavern_Of_Tile","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f3e6b6cbc783dca426cfb037ea5b4f0161d9dc","amp;dn":"mystified+-+Cavern+of+Tile+%5B2006%2FMP3%2F192%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f3e6b6cbc783dca426cfb037ea5b4f0161d9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,243,230,182,203,199,131,220,164,38,207,176,55,234,91,79,1,97,217,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
