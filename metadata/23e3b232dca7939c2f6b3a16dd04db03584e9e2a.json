More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\n\nThis week I go out of my comfort zone and cover the Unsharp Mask. I never found time to get into that thing. Black Art I thought - and well, it is a bit.\nBut I had a good guide, Joel?s Blog told me everything I needed to know. So this show is basically a blatant rip off. ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e3b232dca7939c2f6b3a16dd04db03584e9e2a","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_022_Unsharp_Mask","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e3b232dca7939c2f6b3a16dd04db03584e9e2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,227,178,50,220,167,147,156,47,107,58,22,221,4,219,3,88,78,158,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
