PDFs made available by www.greenanarchy.org.\n\nPlease help seed!!!\n\n\n\n&quot;Intriguingly, [Green Anarchy] manages the difficult feat of being at the same time angry and upbeat. This is theory with its feet firmly in practice, and criticisms with suggestions on how to do things differently...this is a very mature effort from some very mature people&quot;\n\n-- Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed (#57/Spring-Summer 2004)\n\n&quot;An impressive, intelligent, insurrectionary zine that has matured amazingly well.&quot;\n\n-- Fifth Estate (Vol. 39 No.1 - Spring 2004)\n\n&quot;This is an amazing Northwest publication, so much covered in this &quot;anti-civilization&quot; bible of sorts. Damn do these guys have their shit together. Highly recommended.&quot;\n\n-- Profane Existence (#43 - Summer/Fall 2003)\n\n&quot;Whoa, Green Anarchy has changed formats -- gone is the tabloid newsprint and in its place rides this new beast. For those unfamiliar, Green Anarchy is an &quot;anti-civilization journal of theory and action,&quot; and while I'm not totally into their primitivism approach, I do enjoy reading their writings because beneath the thick layers of rhetoric, there are some very well constructed critiques of modern society, as well as the &quot;activist&quot; scene. Always interesting read.&quot;\n\n-- Maximum Rock and Roll (May 2004 #252)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbffc5573487decfcf997ecdf7a4283bcbace94c","amp;dn":"Green_Anarchy_Magazine_6-19.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbffc5573487decfcf997ecdf7a4283bcbace94c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,255,197,87,52,135,222,207,207,153,126,205,247,164,40,59,203,172,233,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
