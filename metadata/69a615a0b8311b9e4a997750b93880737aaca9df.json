Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963 left a psychic wound on America that is with us still today. Few Americans then or now accept that a lone, inconsequential gunman could bring down a president and alter history. In that breach, a culture of conspiracy has arisen that points to sinister forces at work in the shadows. Drawing upon rarely seen archival footage and interviews with key participants, Oswald&amp;#039;s Ghost takes a fresh look at Kennedy&amp;#039;s assassination, the public&amp;#039;s reaction to the tragedy, and the government investigations that instead of calming fears lead to a widespread loss of trust in the institutions that govern our society.\n\nMore info: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oswald/program/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a615a0b8311b9e4a997750b93880737aaca9df","amp;dn":"PBS.American.Experience%5B2008%5DOswald%5C%27s.Ghost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69a615a0b8311b9e4a997750b93880737aaca9df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,166,21,160,184,49,27,158,74,153,119,80,185,56,128,115,122,172,169,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
