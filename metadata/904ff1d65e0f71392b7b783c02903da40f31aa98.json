Not somewhere you would generally think of as being a hotbed of country music talent. He moved to Nashville and got a development deal, but nothing happened with it. But, he worked at his songwriting, learning from other songwriters, and honing his own style, and his debut album, Starting Now will contain many of the tracks that he co-wrote. Out of the eleven tracks on the disc, Chuck had a hand in writing ten of them. \n\n----------\n\n-=About the Album=-\n\nChuck moved from his family farm in Delaware to Nashville, TN so he could concentrate on songwriting. Shortly after his move, RCA Records signed him to a development deal. However, that deal fell through and Wicks became a valet and parked the cars of the songwriters he co-wrote with in the afternoons. For five years he honed his craft to become one of the best songwriters and performers in town. Now, back with RCA Records, he writes about 100 songs a year and collaborates with Nashville&amp;#039;s most respected songwriters (Rivers Rutherford, Troy Verges).\n\nHis debut album is produced by Dann Huff (Rascal Flatts) and Monty Powell, and features his smash hit single &quot;Stealing Cinderella.&quot; Wicks skillfully combines both country and R&amp;B influences into his music with his musical heroes ranging from Alan Jackson to Brian McKnight.\n\nBy T Johnson\n\n----------\n\nARTIST     : Chuck Wicks\nTITLE      : Starting Now\nLABEL      : RCA Records\nGENRE      : Country\nBITRATE    : 183 kbps avg\nSOURCE     : CD (LP)\nPLAYTIME   : 00:40:58\nSIZE       : 56.8MB\nSTORE DATE : 2008-01-00\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n1.
