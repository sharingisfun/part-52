With songs like &quot;Anticonformity,&quot; &quot;The way to Begin&quot; and &quot;My Savior&quot; Krystal lays down what she thinks is the answer to the incredible pressure facing teens.\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. The Way to Begin\n2. My Savior\n3. Fire\n4. Fall to Pieces\n5. Reflections of You\n6. Lovely Traces\n7. Anticonformity\n8. Rescue Me\n9. Sing For Me\n10. Can't Stay\n\n\nIn the 9th grade, Meyers co-wrote &quot;Anticonformity&quot; while at a youth camp. The song quickly became her personal mission statement. Krystal explains, &quot;Anticonformity is more than nonconformity. Nonconformity is not doing what the world wants you to do. Anticonformity is actively being something else - in some cases, the exact opposite of what the world is trying to make you.&quot; \n\nhttp://www.krystalmeyers.com/\nRelease Date: 06/07/05 \nLabel: Essential Records\nDistributed by: Provident\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd83c273a20b6cc5ff4d84ee132078e13e31ffb","amp;dn":"Krystal+Meyers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd83c273a20b6cc5ff4d84ee132078e13e31ffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,216,60,39,58,32,182,204,95,244,216,78,225,50,7,142,19,227,31,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
