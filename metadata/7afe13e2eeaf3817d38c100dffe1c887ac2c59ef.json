Hijack\n 10. Youmud Din\n\nFirst aired: 12/18/2005\n\nThe cell hijacks a truck in order to acquire it&amp;#039;s contents - a deadly chemical to be used in their attack. The FBI holds off on stopping the cell in the hopes of getting more information on the other 2 cells operating in the U.S.\n\nFirst aired: 12/18/2005\n\nJudgement Day has arrived and Fariq isn&amp;#039;t yet out of surprises.
