With the addition of Jeff Davis in 2002 this duo became a trio. Bassist Rich Spencer joined the band in 2004, making the band a quartet. We are frequently supported by the lovely singing voice of piper Kevin Briley&amp;#039;s wife Kristin. The band is based in Bakersfield, California; their motto is &quot;American Bred, Celtic Fed&quot;. Whiskey Galore&amp;#039;s spirited brand of music has stirred fans in various venues in California and Nevada.\n\nWhiskey Galore is a mix of raw and technical musical talent, blended together, producing lively Celtic music that can not be rivaled. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d6a41cd167427becd0c2fac39561bd25fc0352","amp;dn":"Whiskey+Galore+-+Erin%5C%27s+Keel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d6a41cd167427becd0c2fac39561bd25fc0352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,214,164,28,209,103,66,123,236,208,194,250,195,149,97,189,37,252,3,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
