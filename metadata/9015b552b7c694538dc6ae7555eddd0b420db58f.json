It represents a fusion of Mozart&amp;#039;s work with the sounds, rhythms and instruments typical of contemporary Egyptian music.\nThe album saw considerable success in continental Europe, especially France, but had only limited success elsewhere. In August 2005 a second volume (ASIN B0009PEYVW) was released in Europe only, entitled Mozart in Egypt 2.\n\nWhat EMI says:\n==============\nPlunge some desert shepherds into a symphony orchestra, simmer together two radically different musical systems, one (Arab) more ?horizontal?, in which events succeed one another in subtle modes, the other (Mozart) more ?vertical?, where a plethora of simultaneous harmonies and counterpoints are superimposed, and sprinkle with a pinch of humour: result, Mozart in Egypt, a magic carpet ride between East and West, conjuring up a shower of new images and sensations. At a time when relations between the Arab world and the West are far from being at their best, Mozart in Egypt offers hope, a rare example of harmonious co-operation between the two cultures. \n\nBetween Volume I and Volume II the interplay intensifies, Mozart?s scores become more daringly orientalised, and the musicians of each camp don each other?s clothes more often. On with the show!
