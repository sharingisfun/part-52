It's about average for a '60s garage anthology, with some standouts like the Standells' Beatlesque &quot;Someday You'll Cry&quot; (not available on any other CD), the David's garage-pop take on the Doors (&quot;I'm Not Alone&quot;), the Gypsy Trips' folk-rock &quot;Ain't It Hard&quot; (later covered by the Electric Prunes), a pre-Monkees version of &quot;I'm Not Your Stepping Stone&quot; (by the W.C. Fields Memorial Electric String Band), and the blues-rock protest of the Starfires' &quot;Cry for Freedom.&quot; It's the first time on CD for all selections, a few of which had been previously unreissued.\n\nTracks\n1.
