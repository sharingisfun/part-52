Leaving behind her husband, she takes her two kids to the big city. In Tel Aviv, she finds work in what she does best, driving a bus, and rents an apartment in a shady part of the city. But life as a single mom is not easy and Nurit finds that juggling between the demands of her job and her children is more than she can handle. She hires Mushidi (Nathati Moshesh), an illegal immigrant from Ghana, to be a live-in nanny. Instead of paying rent, Mushide cooks and takes care of the children. With Mushidi&amp;#039;s help, Nurit discovers new things about herself.\n\nRelease Date: 9/20/2005\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46298ac345794e950ac16fbc77db7824b47ff608","amp;dn":"Round_Trip_XVID.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46298ac345794e950ac16fbc77db7824b47ff608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,41,138,195,69,121,78,149,10,193,111,188,119,219,120,36,180,127,246,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
