Enlisting in the British Army, fighting in the Seven Years War in Europe, Barry deserts from the British army, joins the Prussian army, gets promoted to the rank of a spy, then becomes pupil to a Chevalier and con artist/gambler. Barry then lies, dupes, duels and seduces his way up the social ladder and enters into a lustful but loveless marriage to a wealthy countess named Lady Lyndon, takes the name of Barry Lyndon, settles in England with wealth and power beyond his wildest dreams, then slowly falls dramatically into ruin.\n\nHave fun! =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:294b19aca8b77e2fb565c351cfaba753791f9433","amp;dn":"Barry.lyndon.1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"294b19aca8b77e2fb565c351cfaba753791f9433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,75,25,172,168,183,126,47,181,101,195,81,207,171,167,83,121,31,148,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
