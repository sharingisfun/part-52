Everyone keeps asking to borrow the samples case so they can take it round their friends.\nwww.newsmells.info\n\nThis is great for short term profits, but what these people don&amp;#039;t realise, is that they are actually doing the business themselves. That is all referral marketing is about. Telling a few friends. \nWe took the case down to the karaoke with us and all the singers were checking out the samples and we sold 23 bottles in one evening.\nHope you enjoy the new Sunflys. 8 of the songs are ones that I specifically requested, if you have any tracks that you have been specially looking for leave a message here and I will compile a new list for the next Sunfly releases.\nEzeRoss\nTop Quality perfume fragrances, not copies www.newsmells.com\nEasy way to make a little money on the side www.newsmells.info\n\nSF263-01 - Kate Nash - Pumpkin Soup.zip                                              \nSF263-02 - The Stereophonics - My Friends.zip                                        \nSF263-03 - Mika - Relax Take It Easy.zip                                             \nSF263-04 - Robyn - Be Mine.zip                                                       \nSF263-05 - Booty Luv - Some Kinda Rush.zip                                           \nSF263-06 - Filo &amp; Perry feat.
