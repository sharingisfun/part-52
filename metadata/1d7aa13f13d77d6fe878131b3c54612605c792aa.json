Indeed, the Buckinghams -- who scored a hit with &quot;Kind of a Drag&quot; (not the song that's included) -- are the only famous band on this compilation. However, the album does feature some interesting minor-league bands, some of which were from Chicago and some of which just recorded there (e.g., the Indiana-based Group, Inc.). Selections include the Omens' &quot;Searching&quot; (later recorded by the Pandoras and the Gravedigger V) and Nobody's Children's &quot;Girl, I Need You&quot; (remade by the Third Booth as &quot;I Need Love&quot;), as well as remakes of songs by the Lemon Drops (&quot;I Live in the Springtime&quot;), the Kingsmen (&quot;Long Green&quot;), the Hollies (&quot;I've Been Wrong&quot;), Gene Vincent (&quot;Say Ma, Ma&quot;), and Elvis Presley (a demented version of &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;). This is not an essential collection but it should appeal to garage rock completists with a particular interest in this geographical region. Note that the song list printed on the CD cover doesn't match the actual order of songs on the CD itself: the Huns' &quot;Winning Ticket&quot; is the third song; &quot;Come With Me&quot; by the Boyz and &quot;Run Around&quot; by the Cavedwellers are not on the CD; and the final track is a radio station promo.\nTracks\n1.\tSearching - The Omens\n2.\tI Love It Baby - The Furniture\n3.\tWinning Ticket - The Huns\n4.\tLive In The Springtime - Buzzsaw\n5.\tI Want Her Back - The Todds\n6.\tLike A Woman - Group.
