Also the movie was obviously created for teenagers and tried too hard to be ÃƒÂ¢??hipÃƒÂ¢??, which it never was.\nWe deleted 50% of spoken text, 99% lame jokes and cut out 22 minutes, which will not be missed. With about 50 cuts we tried to make this a true horror action movie and a worthy finish of the Blade series. We recreated a lot of sound and score elements to alter the overall atmosphere.\n\nTime needed for the edition:\nplanning: 3 months\nediting: 3 weeks\nsound editing: 1 week\nart design: 5 days\ntrailer: 2 days\n\n \n\npersons involved: 5\n\n\n\nThis edit could also be available on other torrent sites, but no further information.\n\nSeveral other people on FANEDIT.ORG might also have this and be willing to trade, also try our FORUM.\n\nYou must own the original movie before downloading any FanEdited movie.
