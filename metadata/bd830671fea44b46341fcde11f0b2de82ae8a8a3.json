The\n album is out on the 4th February and is produced by Tina and her long term\n collaborator Dennis &amp;#039;Ghettoblast&amp;#039; Ahigren.\n\n &amp;#039;Count To Ten&amp;#039; is the follow-up to Tina&amp;#039;s critically acclaimed album &amp;#039;In The Red&amp;#039; and\n is a sumptuous collection of emotive songs delivered with Tina&amp;#039;s trademark - soft yet\n powerful voice. Heavily influenced by the likes of Donovan and Leonard Cohen right\n through to Radiohead, Tina just like her idols - has an incredible gift for melody\n and a strong penchant for poetry.\n\n Tina Dico is best recognised in the UK as &amp;#039;the Voice&amp;#039; on the top Zero 7 tracks &amp;#039;Home&amp;#039;\n and &amp;#039;The Space Between&amp;#039; both of which were hailed as modern reboots of Jodi\n Mitchell&amp;#039;s sunshine folk. Following on from this, she set off around the world with\n the electronic duo, playing the enormo-domes of the UK and the US and gathering a\n steady fanbase along the way.\n\n The super-talened 29-year-old has already impressively beaten Coldplay and U2 to\n Number One in her native Denmark, has won best songwriter Grammy and been voted Best\n Composer at the Danish Music Critics Awards.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd830671fea44b46341fcde11f0b2de82ae8a8a3","amp;dn":"Tina+Dico+-+Count+To+Ten+%28Advance%29+2oo8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd830671fea44b46341fcde11f0b2de82ae8a8a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,131,6,113,254,164,75,70,52,31,205,225,31,11,45,232,42,232,168,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
