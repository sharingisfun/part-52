Check out a podcast with Pip here.\n\nAbout the author:\nPip Coburn studies change for a living. In addition to writing over 300 weekly reports about technology investing, in 2004 and 2005 he released two long-term think-pieces, The Nutcracker Suite and Sour and The Hitchhiker&amp;#039;s Guide to the Changing Galaxy. These reports focus on the user-oriented &quot;Change Function&quot;?a mental model Pip has developed that describes why change takes place and why various technologies are either adopted or not. In June 2006, Pip will release his first book, not surprisingly titled, The Change Function: Why Some Technologies Take Off and Others Crash and Burn. The book address why some technologies are adopted and why most are not. Also, Pip founded, along with his core team from UBS, a firm named Coburn Ventures, an organization that puts its knowledge about &quot;change&quot; to work in the realm of technology, telecom, and media investing. Prior to founding Coburn Ventures, Pip Coburn was a Managing Director and the global technology strategist in the technology group of UBS Investment Research. Pip earned an M.B.A. from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania where he founded the Wharton Fellows Fund; and an A.B. from Brown University.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f67fd1489f2fa398a503e1a494a241a745dfa8b4","amp;dn":"%28PDF%29+%28Manifesto%29+Non-Geeks+are+Not+Morons+The+Change+Function+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f67fd1489f2fa398a503e1a494a241a745dfa8b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,127,209,72,159,47,163,152,165,3,225,164,148,162,65,167,69,223,168,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
