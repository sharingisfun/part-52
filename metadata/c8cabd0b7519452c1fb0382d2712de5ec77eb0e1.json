Your adrenaline pumps as machinegun fire pelts off your\n  tail, you execute backbreaking barrel rolls and experience\n  dog-fighting action. Take your pick of over 70 planes, including real\n  and imagined military fighters. With a full range of extreme missions\n  to numb your senses, AirForce Delta Storm pushes your Xbox to the sky!  \n\n  * Featuring over 70 aircraft including the F-14 Tomcat, F/A-18 Hornet\n    and A-10 Thunderbolt \n\n  * A full array of 50 unique missions to challenge players of all\n    levels \n\n  * A dynamic mix of arcade action and combat simulation \n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &quot;MODE1/2048&quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.\n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X-\n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  /\n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    /\n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     /\n                              ___/              /        _ _\n\n\nLINKS:\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/xbox/sim/airforcedeltastorm/news_2800330.html\nhttp://www.xboxexclusive.com/reviews/AFD/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cabd0b7519452c1fb0382d2712de5ec77eb0e1","amp;dn":"Air+Force+Delta+Storm+XBOX+-+ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cabd0b7519452c1fb0382d2712de5ec77eb0e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,202,189,11,117,25,69,44,31,176,56,45,39,18,222,94,199,126,176,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
