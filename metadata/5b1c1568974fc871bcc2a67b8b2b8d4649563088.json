They evolved out of &amp;#039;70s band Mickey Ratt, transmuting into their present form in 1983, with a hint of pop about their brand of metal similar to Cheap Trick or Aerosmith. They released a self-titled mini-album in 1983 on a local label, and struck up a close personal friendship with members of MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e which no doubt helped them to sign to Atlantic the following year. They made their breakthrough with their first full album, OUT OF THE CELLAR, which stayed in the Billboard Top 20 for six months. They toured with Ozzy Osbourne before joining a Billy Squier jaunt where they were apparently &amp;#039;thrown off&amp;#039; because they were more popular than the headline act. Their subsequent output has seen them follow a familiar heavy metal route with accusations over sexist videos contrasting with their ability to sell out concert halls and produce recordings that regularly received gold discs. Detonator featured several songs co-written with Desmond Child and proved their most adventurous recording to date, though Crosby would depart after RAT &amp;#039;N&amp;#039; ROLL. In 1993 Pearcy unveiled his new outfit, Arcade, confirming the dissolution of the band.\n\nThe band reformed with a new album in 1999. Pearcy would leave the band not long after, unhappy with the album and chemistry. Jizzy Pearl of Love/Hate replaced him and has toured with the band since.
