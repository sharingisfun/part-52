As the first foreign journalists to visit the city of Jaffna, Jordan and Sinnerton discover that the government has abandoned the ceasefire signed in 2002 in favour of a military campaign against the rebel Tamil Tigers - with many innocent civilians paying the price.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Civil War is an ongoing conflict on the island-nation of Sri Lanka. Since the year 1983, there has been on-and-off civil war, predominantly between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers), a separatist militant organization who fight to create an independent state named Tamil Eelam in the North and East of the island.\n\nThe origins of the Sri Lankan civil war lie in sharp disagreements over language, access to universities, and riots between Sri Lanka&amp;#039;s majority Sinhalese, mostly Buddhist, and minority Tamil, mostly Hindu, community. These gradually but continuously escalated from the 1920s until the outbreak of civil war in 1983.\n\n \n\nÃ‚Â©Ã‚Â¦ Air Date: Same as release date.\nÃ‚Â©Ã‚Â¦ Release Date: 09/11/2007\t\nÃ‚Â©Ã‚Â¦ Format: XviD 2 Pass\nÃ‚Â©Ã‚Â¦ Video: 640 x 352 @ 25fps\nÃ‚Â©Ã‚Â¦ Audio: VBR MP3 ~128k\n\npdtv.xvid-remax\nshunster repost and combo description\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8530c229b3ee0637983f2c6b10e64fd1ed72be4f","amp;dn":"Unreported+World%7ESri+Lanka+Killing+For+Peace+2007+11+09+avi+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8530c229b3ee0637983f2c6b10e64fd1ed72be4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,48,194,41,179,238,6,55,152,63,44,107,16,230,79,209,237,114,190,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
