Trust me, if you are making any sort of club/dance or commercial music, there is nothing here for you. The samples often sound like &quot;noise&quot; rather than music.\n\nIf, however, you want to make slow ambient electronica, then you should get this for the hundreds of rhythmic parts, melodies, pads and effects.\nAll files are normalized Acidized WAVs at 44.1KHz\n\nMore details and mp3 previews at: http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/loop_libraries/showloop.asp?SPID=298\n\nMy next upload should be more useful to the majority of my regular users, so keep checking back.\n\n--\nArty - &quot;I thought we lived in a post-industrial society...&quot;\n5th Feb 2008 (Super Tuesday)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad9225bc0f3e28252d98c546aa0c91ecd90a2218","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+37-Sony+Acid-Either+Or+Electronica+by+Twine-WAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad9225bc0f3e28252d98c546aa0c91ecd90a2218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,146,37,188,15,62,40,37,45,152,197,70,170,12,145,236,217,10,34,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
