Enjoy.\n\nFrom the README:\n\n9a466 works great on Intel AMD and SSE2 Machines.\n9a499 is still a work in progress and isn&amp;#039;t fully working on all machines yet.  Right now it&amp;#039;s Intel/AMD.  Even though all the bugs haven&amp;#039;t been worked out, it&amp;#039;s still fun to play with.\n\nJust go into the appropriate directory and follow the instructions.  A patcher was made because it&amp;#039;s all still beta software and it would be silly for you to have to download ANOTHER leopard beta DVD.\n\nBe sure to install on a drive that already has the Darwin Bootloader on it.  It might be necessary to install tiger first, as leopard DVD&amp;#039;s do not install the bootloader.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s gonna be hard to find help with Leopard.  Imac has already stated they don&amp;#039;t want anything to do with Leopard and will delete your posts about it, and Netka and Semthex&amp;#039;s boards are just as bad.  About the only board you will find help is at http://www.osx86scene.com  They seem the most willing to help.  It&amp;#039;s worth a shot.  And on IRC, .hu will not help you with it at all.  The people at irc.moofspeak.net will be the most willing to help you.  Have fun with Apple&amp;#039;s newest big cat.\nThe Mad Hatter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c2fdab9f50ba73bf5fa2e0422011c9beaca4495","amp;dn":"Leopard+9A466%2F9A499+AMD+%2B+Intel+Kernel+Patches+and+Decrypts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c2fdab9f50ba73bf5fa2e0422011c9beaca4495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,47,218,185,245,11,167,59,245,250,46,4,34,1,28,155,234,202,68,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
