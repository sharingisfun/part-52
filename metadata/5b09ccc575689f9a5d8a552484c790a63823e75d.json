From where did they come? How did they arrive? The thought about when people first reached America in about 12.000 years ago was a long time thought of as an absolute truth by the establishment in science. This version was so accepted that few archaeologists even bothered to look for artefacts from periods before 10,000BC. But when people did, they found that people have been living in America for at least 16.000-20.000 years. But that is problematic because science has a long time thought that the &quot;gate over Bering Strait&quot; from Asia was closed in that time by the ice masses of the ice age.\n\nIn this torrent I chose to include both the original BBC Horizon version aired in 2002 in the UK and the PBS Nova version aired in 2004 in America.\n\nIf you watch both the versions of the same material you can see the political concerns taken in both versions. Europeans in the BBC Horizon version are eager to claim that they after all were the first in America. In this version of the show the conclusion is just that. The Horizon version even says that the people came from France and that they colonized most of America along side with the Asians who came later. And this version is even called &quot;Stone age Columbus&quot;. In this version they even find a Native American who says it doesn?t matter because ?we are all humans?. Witch is obviously true.\n\nHowever in the Nova version aired 2 years later they are not so sure. It?s a possibility as they diplomatically present it, perhaps thinking of the native people, but they present other possibilities as well. For instance people can have taken the sea route on the Alaska west coast. A much shorter distance then over the Atlantic ocean. The Nova version is called America?s stone age explorers.\n\nI find watching both versions and comparing them just as interesting as the point they try to make in both the TV shows. And I don?t say I don?t believe in the theory they presents. That is not the point here.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther torrents related to my favorite subject; humans and human behaviour:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b09ccc575689f9a5d8a552484c790a63823e75d","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon%2FPBS+Nova+-+Stone+age+Columbus%2FAmerica%3Fs+stone+age+ex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b09ccc575689f9a5d8a552484c790a63823e75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,9,204,197,117,104,159,154,93,138,85,36,132,199,144,166,56,35,231,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
