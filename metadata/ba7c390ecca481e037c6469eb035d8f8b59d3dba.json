I have followed Baddiel and Skinner from the Fantasy Football shows and the banter between the two is still alive and well. In fact, it's better. I watched this and could not stop laughing out loud as it's packed full of rude, clever and down right silly jokes and comments. I would be so surprised if someone managed to sit all the way through it without laughing! Just hope the TV series comes back on soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba7c390ecca481e037c6469eb035d8f8b59d3dba","amp;dn":"Baddiel+And+Skinner+-+Unplanned+Live%2C+Westend+%5BKitCh+%2B+DomZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba7c390ecca481e037c6469eb035d8f8b59d3dba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,124,57,14,204,164,129,224,55,198,70,158,176,53,216,248,181,157,61,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
