It&amp;#039;s a collection of songs from throughout China&amp;#039;s musical history. To be honest it&amp;#039;s actually pretty good.\n\nIncludes folk songs, instrumentals, old Chinese opera music, &quot;Two Butterflies&quot; (a modern cantopop song), and others.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s in 320 kb/s mp3. Oh yeah and I added scans of the cover/ song list too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f645aa52b637e00fb993609f11baf115dc97d09","amp;dn":"USAD+2006-2007+The+Music+Of+China","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f645aa52b637e00fb993609f11baf115dc97d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,100,90,165,43,99,126,0,251,153,54,9,241,27,175,17,93,201,125,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
