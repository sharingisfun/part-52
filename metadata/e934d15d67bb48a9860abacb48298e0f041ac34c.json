Playing what was like a drum pad he beat out video samples from cheesy American 'Teach yourself to play the drums' videos. Though rough round the edges during it's debut performance, it had everyone captivated - even the security guards at the front of the stage turned round and were nodding heads, joining the huge cheers from the crowd at the end!\n\nBeing allowed an encore of 15 minutes (but actually taking 25), we got some &quot;greatest hits&quot; which brought the crowd that had started to filter off home back to dancefloor to the sound of &quot;You Can't Go Home Again&quot;.\n\nMind blowing. \n--------------------------------------\nAwesome Hip-Hip beats...PeAcE\n--------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e934d15d67bb48a9860abacb48298e0f041ac34c","amp;dn":"DJ+Shadow+-+Live+at+One+Live+in+Nottingham+-+11-04-2002.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e934d15d67bb48a9860abacb48298e0f041ac34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,52,209,93,103,187,72,169,134,10,186,203,72,41,142,15,4,26,195,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
