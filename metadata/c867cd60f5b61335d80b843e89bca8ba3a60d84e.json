The Doctor finds a way to communicate with the creature, which explains that there has been such a protracted silence from him communicating with his race, that they have sent a neutron star towards Chloris to destroy it. The Doctor has to join forces with the creature to save the planet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c867cd60f5b61335d80b843e89bca8ba3a60d84e","amp;dn":"Dr+Who+-+S17E03+-+P1+-+The+Creature+from+the+Pit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c867cd60f5b61335d80b843e89bca8ba3a60d84e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,103,205,96,245,182,19,53,216,11,132,62,137,188,168,186,58,96,216,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
