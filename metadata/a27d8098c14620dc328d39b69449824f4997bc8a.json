I had to resync the subtitle file in order for it to match with FFF&amp;#039;s video, but unfortunately it is still a bit out of sync on some places.\n\nStill, I think it is better than nothing, and it made it possible for me to watch Antropophagus and actually understand what was going on. I don&amp;#039;t remember where I got the original srt file from.\n\n\nI have included FFF&amp;#039;s Antropophagus torrent in this distribution, but you can also find it here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3813732/Antropophagus_-_(1980_Joe_D_Amato_Deutsch_Uncut_Splatter)....&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3813732/Antropophagus_-_(1980_Joe_D_Amato_Deutsch_Uncut_Splatter)....&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a27d8098c14620dc328d39b69449824f4997bc8a","amp;dn":"Antropophagus+-+english+subs+%5BElgerHz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a27d8098c14620dc328d39b69449824f4997bc8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,125,128,152,193,70,32,220,50,141,57,182,148,73,130,79,73,151,188,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
