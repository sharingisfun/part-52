Vaughn\nArtists : Philip Bond, Eduardo Barreto\n\nDiscovering his late father&amp;#039;s decades-spanning vault of Escapist memorabilia at the age of six, Max became a fan of the Master of Elusion almost overnight. After exhausting the extensive stash of Golden and Silver Age comics, he needed more-and started writing his own Escapist stories. Now nineteen, he&amp;#039;s determined to make the character a sensation once again, but where is he going to find an artist-in Cleveland? Meet Maxwell Roth and Case Weaver, latter-day versions of Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay.\n\n[b]Thanks to the original scanners and uploaders.\n\nPlease keep seeding![/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1577d217c30e3c8d373a0ca31e961271fc72376b","amp;dn":"The+Escapists+%5BBigBonedNinja%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1577d217c30e3c8d373a0ca31e961271fc72376b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,119,210,23,195,14,60,141,55,58,12,163,30,150,18,113,252,114,55,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
