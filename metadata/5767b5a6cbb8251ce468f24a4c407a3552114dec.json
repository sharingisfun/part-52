Looks a bit fuzzy when viewed at full screen, but so does the original .mov. \nIf you'd like to view/download the original .mov, it's located at:\nhttp://www.beam.tv/beamreels/play_clip.php?reel_file=dKDTJYPDTz&amp;action=open\n\nThis is a goofy, cute and funny video, a nice change in pace from the wistful Feel Good Inc. The ending is especially laughable. \nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5767b5a6cbb8251ce468f24a4c407a3552114dec","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+Video--Dare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5767b5a6cbb8251ce468f24a4c407a3552114dec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,103,181,166,203,184,37,28,228,104,242,74,76,64,122,53,82,17,77,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
