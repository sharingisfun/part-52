Anderson original by serving as a straight up sci-fi horror scare-fest.\n\nThe epic score by composer Brian Tyler is truly apocalyptic. Its a massive, driving, powerful orchestra assault that adds an exciting new opus to the previous franchise scores of Jerry Goldsmith (Alien), Alan Silvestri (Predator, Predator 2), James Horner (Aliens) and Elliot Goldenthal (Alien 3). \n\n\nTRACK LISTING:\n\n1.
