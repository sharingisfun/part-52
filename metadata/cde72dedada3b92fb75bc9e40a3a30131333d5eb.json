This book, his tenth, points to a sure way out of life&amp;#039;s hells.\n\nUsing real-life stories, Arnold exposes the common seeds of loneliness, frustration, alienation, and despair, and gives you the tools to uproot them from your life. In contrast to the makeovers and quick fixes hawked by popular culture, Escape Routes offers a tougher prescription. The choices he presents are clear: &quot;to be selfish or selfless; to forgive or to hate; to burn with lust or with love; to defend your personal power, or dismantle it.&quot;\n\nWhy stake your hopes on some eternal hereafter, when you can taste heaven right here and now? No matter your problems, or who you are, this book will help you on your way, provided you&amp;#039;re ready to take its medicine.\n\n\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde72dedada3b92fb75bc9e40a3a30131333d5eb","amp;dn":"Escape+Routes+For+People+Who+Feel+Trapped+in+Life%5C%27s+Hells+eBooK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde72dedada3b92fb75bc9e40a3a30131333d5eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,231,45,237,173,163,185,47,183,91,201,228,10,58,48,19,19,51,213,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
