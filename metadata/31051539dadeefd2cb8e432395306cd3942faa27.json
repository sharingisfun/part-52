It basically lets you create posed and animated human and animal figures and add them to your paper or Web based creations.\n\nThis latest version includes what it calls cupboards full of clothing to dress up your animated beings and bottom up figure sculpting. To give that hand-drawn touch to figures, MetaCreations has added a natural-media Sketch Renderer tool. Advanced texturing features, such as transparency and reflectivity, are provided with the inclusion of a special edition of the companys Painter 3D texturing programme. Web functionality has naturally been beefed-up as well, with direct access to content on the Poser sites and the ability to output figures to the Web via the MetaStream open 3D file format. The accompanying CD contains additional props, poses, motion capture files, texture maps and morph targets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31051539dadeefd2cb8e432395306cd3942faa27","amp;dn":"Poser+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31051539dadeefd2cb8e432395306cd3942faa27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,5,21,57,218,222,239,210,203,142,67,35,149,48,108,211,148,47,170,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
