Artois is the owner and manager of a caf?? in German-occupied France of World War II. To look at him, it&amp;#039;s hard to believe that some women find him irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith. Ren??&amp;#039;s cafe, frequented by both the German military and the French resistance, is the focal point for the show. Ren??&amp;#039;s a bit of a coward and is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the cafe are two English airmen who don&amp;#039;t understand a word of French. Other characters include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his small sidekick. Ren??&amp;#039;s not the only coward in town: Capt. Hans Geering and Col. Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive along with Capt. Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army, who has a medal for servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an English agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of &quot;Zee Fronch Linguige&quot;, and from Ren??&amp;#039;s amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa038eed5af1529f133323b5670be49ec0681a4","amp;dn":"Allo+Allo+DVD+2%2F5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa038eed5af1529f133323b5670be49ec0681a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,160,56,238,213,175,21,41,241,51,50,59,86,112,190,73,236,6,129,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
