[http://www.simplysup.com/ ]\n\nRELEASE iNFOS\n\nTrojan Remover was written to aid in the removal of Trojan Horses\nand Internet Worms when standard anti-virus software has either\nfailed to detect the problem or is unable to effectively eliminate it.\n\nTrojan Remover has been written for Windows\n95/98/Millennium/XP/Server 2003. It has been successfully\nused by Windows 2000 users, although this platform has not been\nofficially tested.\nThe majority of Virus and Trojan Scanners are well able to detect\nmalicious Trojan Horses and Internet Worms but are not always\nvery efficient in removing them once they have been triggered.\nTrojan Remover was written specifically to carry out such a\nremoval without the user having to manually edit system files,\nincluding the Registry. The program also removes the additional\nsystem modifications some Trojans carry out which are ignored\nby other Virus and Trojan Scanners.\n\niNSTALL NOTES\n\n1. Unpack &amp; Install.\n2. Replace all files.\n\nABOUT GROUP\n\nFighting For Fun Team is proud to announce we are the First\nFrench Web Group still alive and with more than 9000 releases\nnow.
