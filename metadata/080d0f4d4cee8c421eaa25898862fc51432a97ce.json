Victory\n\nWritten by Sacraphobic  on August 20th, 2004\n\nA blizzard is conjured, a crystal sheet penetrating the darkness, glistening with strength. The strength of your ancestors, your people, as you and they become one with the Earth. You are a warrior, and you will die honourably, at peace with yourself and with your world. You will wait for the storms.\n\nAh, this is a beauty - one to which I can&amp;#039;t hope to do justice with mere words. Ambient, pulsing rhythms reminiscent of a ship rocking on stormy seas. Folk-tinged melodies vary subtly against a blanket of white noise which dominates the CD. Rhythmically driven by the drums which throb broodingly in the background. Vocals aren&amp;#039;t prominent either - deep, lengthy growls, adding an extra layer of darkness and rhythm to the music. The album closes with a reflective Celtic tune which is very aptly named &quot;Celtic Harp Solo&quot;, having opened with an ominous piano piece. In addition, the production is excellent.\n\nIn a way similar to the very best of Burzum and Sacramentum, Aeternus succeed at disconnecting the listener and transporting them to an unexplored world with endless possibilities.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080d0f4d4cee8c421eaa25898862fc51432a97ce","amp;dn":"Aeternus+-+Beyond+the+Wandering+Moon+%28FLAC%29+2003+reissue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080d0f4d4cee8c421eaa25898862fc51432a97ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,13,15,77,76,238,140,66,30,170,37,137,136,98,252,81,67,42,151,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
