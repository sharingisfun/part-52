You can use the templates as a starting point for your own design (or you can start with a blank template and build your own layout from scratch). There are no limitations in the graphical design that you can create for your website (as is the case with many template based solutions).\n\n-- Visual editing\nSite Studio&amp;#039;s visual editor shows you how the final page looks like while editing, i.e. WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing. WYSIWYG editing (What You See Is What You Get) is used to edit and create websites. It&amp;#039;s just as easy as word processing tools.\n\n-- Modern Standards - XHTML and CSS\nSite Studio generates web pages which conform to the XHTML 1.0 strict standard. \nXHTML is the successor to HTML since 2000. XHTML is based on XML and describes the content instead of describing how it should be shown. \nSince XHTML is based on XML, the syntax for XHTML is the same as is used for XML. Read more about XHTML at the website &quot;The World Wide Web Consortium&quot;. You can read more about XHTML at: http://www.w3.org\n\n-- Search function\nTo make it easier for you web site visitors to navigate on your website it is an advantage if your site has a search function. Site Studio provides a built-in function to create fully searchable websites without using server programming. You can see how it works by using the search function on this website.\n\n-- Flash\nThere is built-in support for Flash in Site Studio. You can add a Flash movie to the website as easily as adding an image. \n\n-- Automatically generated menus\nMenus are automatically updated as documents are added, deleted or changed. Therefore, there is no need to update menus on individual pages. Even graphical menus (which use images) are updated automatically. Site Studio creates necessary images on the fly.\n\n-- Powerful image gallery functions\nSite Studio has powerful image gallery functions for a versatile presentation of digital images.\nImages can automatically be resized to a web format when imported. There is no need for a separate image editing software to publish you pictures.\n\n-- Actions (hyperlinks)\nActions suchs as hyperlinks are used to navigate to external or internal web pages. Actions also have &quot;smart&quot; links which allow for linking to the previous and next document. Links can also be made to documents and other files within the project as resources.\n\n-- Document groups\nDocument groups are used for grouping documents, i e document groups contain documents which are related in some way. For example, a document group could contain all documents concerning a certain company issue. A document group can be used as the source for menus making it easy to build custom menus.\n\n-- Document Properties\nEach document has a document body, i e it&amp;#039;s content. Additionally a document has several properties, such as the document title, date of creation, last modified date, primary colors, associated resource folders etc. These properties are then used together with a layout and it&amp;#039;s components to create a unique web page.\n\n-- Color Schemes. Same Site ? Different Colors\nProject colors in Site Studio is a collection of 28 colors. Instead of selecting fixed colors, whenever you select a color, you can select a project color. When a project color is changed, all references to it will also change. This makes it easy to change colors on your web site. Site Studio comes with a number of pre-made color schemes for you to choose from which you can even save and personalize as your own. \n\n-- Graphical Rendering Engine Images (GRE Images)\nSite Studio has a graphical rendering engine which assembles images on the fly. These are called GRE Images. GRE Images are built dynamically using blueprints called GRE Styles. A GRE Style is a description of how a GRE image should be assembled. For example, it contains information on what background color to use, how text should be applied and formatted, whether symbols should be blended onto the image etcetera. This powerful feature makes it possible to create graphical menus and labels.\n\n-- Fields\nFields are placeholders for data contained in the website project. In Site Studio there are two types of fields; project fields and documents fields. For instance; the Document Title is a document field. By inserting the Document Title field instead of typing a fixed title in a layout, the field will be replaced with the title for each individual document.\n\n-- Resource Management\nAll external files, including images, are stored as project resources. When images are imported they will be copied into the project resources folder. Resources are organized using resource folders which is very useful, especially as the amount of resources used in the project grow in number.\n\n-- Styles\nA style is a description on how a paragraph should be formatted. The built-in styles are Heading 1 to 6 and Normal. \nUsing styles makes it easy to maintain a consistent design throughout the website.\n\n-- Import Images\nSite Studio offers functionality to optimize images for the web. Usually when importing images from a digital camera they are too large to be placed on a web page. Site Studio can automatically resize images, which makes it easy to import images in batches and to create image galleries.\n\n-- Site Studio Library\nThe Site Studio Library is a library of graphics for you to use in GRE-images. Buttons, tabs, symbols, backgrounds and more.\n\n-- Upload (one-click smart update)\nSite Studio offers a function for publishing websites to a server from where others can reach your website. Site Studio can be published through the local network to a file server or a web server via ftp. Site Studio uses a smart synchronization mechanism which keeps track of which files are updated. This minimizes the bandwidth needed for uploading.\n\nSystem Requirements\nOperating System Microsoft Windows\n98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista\nSoftware Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or later\nRAM 128 MB\nDisk space 100 MB of existing disk space\nCPU Intel Pentium, 500 MHz or equivalent\nOther Mouse\n\nAll web servers supported\n\nSince Site Studio produces pages conforming to the XHTML standard, there are no specific requirements on the web server used for the website. Any web server and platform can be used. \n\nFile Viewing\n\nWebsites created with Site Studio can also be viewed through the file system of a windows computer, which allows for many exciting ways of use, such as presentations, image galleries, etc.\n\nSite Studio has officially been verified by Microsoft:&quot;Verified for Windows XP&quot;.\n\nhave fun and enjoy The Joker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d86ab0da9390cc42d51ef78ad8040df02a211d3","amp;dn":"Effective+SiteStudio+Professional+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d86ab0da9390cc42d51ef78ad8040df02a211d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,134,171,13,169,57,12,196,45,81,239,120,173,128,64,223,2,162,17,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
