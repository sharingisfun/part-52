Based on a story by Daphne du Maurier, whose works inspired Alfred Hitchcock&amp;#039;s Rebecca and The Birds, the film centers on Laura and John Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie), who have recently relocated to Venice so that John can oversee the architectural restoration of an old church. Both hope that the change of environment will allow them to forget the recent tragic demise of their child, but they instead find themselves surrounded by reminders of death, as the city attempts to deal with a series of unexplained murders. The eeriness intensifies when they encounter a blind psychic and her eccentric sister, who promise to contact her daughter&amp;#039;s spirit. Laura embraces the idea, but John remains skeptical until he experiences his own visions: fleeting glimpses of someone in a red coat similar to one that belonged to his daughter.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0069995/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0069995/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBrought to you by...\n                                    oo\n                                   $&quot;&quot;$o\n                                  $&quot;  $$\n                                   $$$$\n                                   o &quot;$o\n                                  o&quot;  &quot;$\n             oo&quot;$$$&quot;  oo$&quot;$ooo   o$    &quot;$    ooo&quot;$oo  $$$&quot;o\no o o o    oo&quot;  o&quot;      &quot;o    $$o$&quot;     o o$&quot;&quot;  o$      &quot;$  &quot;oo   o o o o\n&quot;$o   &quot;&quot;$$$&quot;   $$         $      &quot;   o   &quot;&quot;    o&quot;         $   &quot;o$$&quot;    o$$\n  &quot;&quot;o       o  $          $&quot;       $$$$$       o          $  ooo     o&quot;&quot;\n     &quot;o   $$$$o $o       o$        $$$$$&quot;       $o        &quot; $$$$   o&quot;\n      &quot;&quot;o $$$$o  oo o  o$&quot;         $$$$$&quot;        &quot;o o o o&quot;  &quot;$$$  $\n        &quot;&quot; &quot;$&quot;     &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;            &quot;&quot;$&quot;            &quot;&quot;&quot;      &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;\n         &quot;oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo$\n          &quot;$$$$&quot;$$$$&quot; $$$$$$$&quot;$$$$$$ &quot; &quot;$$$$$&quot;$$$$$$&quot;  $$$&quot;&quot;$$$$\n           $$$oo$$$$   $$$$$$o$$$$$$o&quot; $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ o$$$$o$$$&quot;\n           $&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;$\n           $&quot;                    NAXOSKING                     o\n           $&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$&quot;$$$\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff470db44d99b50ceadfd05694f31bfe138e4d3","amp;dn":"Don%5C%27t.Look.Now.%5B1973%5D.DVDrip%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff470db44d99b50ceadfd05694f31bfe138e4d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,244,112,219,68,217,155,80,206,173,253,5,105,79,49,191,225,56,228,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
