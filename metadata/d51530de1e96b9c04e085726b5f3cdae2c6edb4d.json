All My Tears (Julie Miller cover, cuts out)\n\nNOTES:  It only took me about 2-3 seconds to change the tape from side a to side b, so I just lost the last note of &quot;God Will Lift Up Your Head.&quot;  The tape ran dry after capturing most but not quite all of &quot;All My Tears.&quot;  Jars played &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; after that, which was not taped by myself.  I left during &quot;I'll Fly Away,&quot; so I don't know if they played anything else.  Please note that this was the second of two sets, played at 5:15 pm and 8:15 pm that night.  I didn't attend the first set.  Chris Lehman told me he planned on videotaping both performances.  If he did, his recording probably sounds a lot better than mine, recorded on a telephone-quality microcassette.  However, until his recording surfaces, mine may entertain.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d51530de1e96b9c04e085726b5f3cdae2c6edb4d","amp;dn":"Jars+Of+Clay+live+2005-08-07%2C+late+show%2C+Decatur%2C+IL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d51530de1e96b9c04e085726b5f3cdae2c6edb4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,21,48,222,30,150,185,192,78,8,87,38,181,243,205,174,44,110,219,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
