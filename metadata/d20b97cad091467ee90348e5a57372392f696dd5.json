Thanks to all geeks that helped me by being the best teammates imaginable.\n\nNevertheless, this brought me to the idea to make a movie... and here it is.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Movie is divided in three Parts. \n\nFirst of all I start with some outdoor PvP and Battlegrounds. ( I know there are some undergeared opponents, just watch and don\\&amp;#039;t complain about that. Show me your movie where you only fight full gladiator geared players and I will delete this sentence :) ) \n\nIn the second part you will see exclusively berserk and trinket useage in battlegrounds ( mostly WS ). \n                      !!WARNING!! \n[If you dont\\&amp;#039;t like partially undergeared opponents, berserk abuse, oneshots, high crits or lots of zooming, you should NOT download this movie or just skip it from minute 5 to 10 :)) ]\n\nIn the third part you will only see Arena PvP, I added some 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5. ( Note, that I usually play WITH nameplates, I just turned them OFF for this movie. I think nameplates would suck in it )\n\nOk, I think I said everything worth knowing according to the content.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMusic: \n\nRammstein - Mein Herz brennt\nAtreyu - My fork in the road ( your knife in my back )\nClawfinger - Do what I say\nThe RZA - Ode to Oren Ishii\nDisturbed - Stricken\nThe Legion of Doom - Lolitas Medicine\nSerj Tankian - Saving Us\n\n                 !! WARNING !!\nIf you don\\&amp;#039;t like the music, I suggest to just turn your sound off and listen to your own tracks :p \nDon\\&amp;#039;t flame about that pls, it\\&amp;#039; s not that easy to come up with new music.\n\nThat\\&amp;#039;s it, Enjoy the movie!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d20b97cad091467ee90348e5a57372392f696dd5","amp;dn":"Triple+G.+-+WoW+PvP+and+Arena+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d20b97cad091467ee90348e5a57372392f696dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,11,151,202,208,145,70,126,233,3,72,229,165,115,114,57,47,105,109,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
