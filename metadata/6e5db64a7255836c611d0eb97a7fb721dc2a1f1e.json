This time around Blood Meridian delve pretty deep into an early 60&amp;#039;s vibe where fans of the earlier ESP folkier records, Skip Spence&amp;#039;s Oar and maybe even a little early Bob Seger System will find comfort in the grooves of Liquidate Paris. This record began as more of an experiment, tracking to a Tascam 8 track cassette recorder in early 2007 in a moldy basement beneath a crack infested street in Vancouver which really helped produce the overall spooky vibe.\nFor fans of Neil Young, Skip Spence, and the 13th Floor Elevators.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5db64a7255836c611d0eb97a7fb721dc2a1f1e","amp;dn":"Blood+Meridian+-+Liquidate+Paris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5db64a7255836c611d0eb97a7fb721dc2a1f1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,93,182,74,114,85,131,108,97,29,14,185,122,127,183,33,220,42,31,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
