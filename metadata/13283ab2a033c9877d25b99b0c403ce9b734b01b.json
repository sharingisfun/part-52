A TV rip from Japanese TV\n\n--&gt; Excellent picture quality, but missing several rounds and ring entrances, fights are in wrong order, commentary -logically- in Japanese\n\n\n2. A TV rip from French TV\n\n--&gt; Rather poor picture quality, missing several rounds and ring entrances, commentary in French, rather boring all in all\n\n\n3. Several wmv files without connection (i.e. no full event), therefore unsatisfying to watch; very poor picture quality, sound stereo but somehow one channel only\n\n\n\nConclusion: None of these versions is really great, yet any of them has something to contribute to the whole.\n\nSolution: Put 'em together!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13283ab2a033c9877d25b99b0c403ce9b734b01b","amp;dn":"K-1+World+GP+2005+Paris+-hellspawn+special+Mix-+CD1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13283ab2a033c9877d25b99b0c403ce9b734b01b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,40,58,178,160,51,201,135,125,37,185,155,12,64,60,233,183,52,176,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
