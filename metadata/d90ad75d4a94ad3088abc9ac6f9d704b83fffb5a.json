This it the US/English version of the player. \n\nThis will most likely only work with the G15-AV501R, but may work with other models.  \n\nIf your laptop did not come with this recovery CD, and you&amp;#039;ve upgraded your harddrives or otherwise deleted the Qosmioplayer partition on your hard drive, you will need this CD to successfully recover it. \n\nToshiba gives you this CD for &quot;free&quot; but then charges $39.99 or more for shipping charges, which is absolutely outrageous.  I&amp;#039;m uploading this because I ended up having to pay for it and wanted to avoid that for other individuals.\n\nQosmioplayer is a Linux-based mini-OS used for audio &amp; video playback, and it appears each version of the software is custom-built around an individual laptop model&amp;#039;s hardware specifications. I believe this version requires 100mb of unused, unpartitioned space on the first hard drive installed in your system.  Other newer versions of this software require more space.\n\nGood luck, and enjoy!  \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d90ad75d4a94ad3088abc9ac6f9d704b83fffb5a","amp;dn":"Toshiba+Qosmioplayer+v+3.1+Recovery+CD+%28for+G15-AV501R%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d90ad75d4a94ad3088abc9ac6f9d704b83fffb5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,10,215,93,74,148,173,48,136,171,201,172,111,157,112,75,131,255,251,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
