Walt is very happy (and lucky, quite frankly) not to be a telephone solicitor. He created The King of Persia with the help of a Xeric grant in 1996 and put out the 4 part series, Poot, for Fantagraphics in 1998. In 2001, he animated and directed the &quot;The Courtship of Sniffy LaPants&quot;, which can be seen at http://sniffpants.com. Some of the animation is a little doubtful, but he still kind of likes it. The music is brilliant, at any rate.\n\nMusicians from the same tango orchestra of &quot;Waking Life&quot;, even! His latest work, &quot;Hails at Sea&quot;, yet another scathing self-portrait, is a loose narrative of dreams from 1998 - 2004. Walt hopes to become a real craftsman one day; a cobbler or a cooper, perhaps. \n\nserializer.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8df30c05aeb14a1e9b434b7c20b5030e34538f0","amp;dn":"walt+holcombe+%5Bpoot%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8df30c05aeb14a1e9b434b7c20b5030e34538f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,223,48,192,90,235,20,161,233,180,52,183,194,11,80,48,227,69,56,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
