The software looks like an OK program, nothing special though. There are free programs such as CPUZ that could probably do most of things this can. Nevertheless feel free to download and report back what you think.\n\nSince 1994 Dr. Hardware is among the most advanced system information programs on the market. This program is made for beginners and professional users, for your desktop and notebook PC.\n\nDr. Hardware covers the whole machine and includes not only the common stuff (like processor detection etc.) but also some more sophisticated tests like hardware sensor, ATA/S-ATA/Atapi and network analysis. Also it comes with 7 benchmark tests and provides full support for all 32 and 64 Bit Windows desktop versions: Windows 95, 98, Me, NT4, 2000, 2003, XP and Vista.\n\nProgram Features:\n\n    * Detailed analysis of core hardware and connected devices of personal computers\n    * Detects processor, BIOS, cache, bus system\n    * Detailed information for many current main board chipsets\n    * Examines hard disk, CD ROM, modem, VGA adapter\n    * Lists your (E-)IDE, ATAPI and SCSI devices\n    * Plus more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ef0f58f926e85d275883a86a3af1b4956781681","amp;dn":"+Dr+Hardware+2007+Premium+v8.5.0e+InclKey-DEC0DE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ef0f58f926e85d275883a86a3af1b4956781681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,240,245,143,146,110,133,210,117,136,58,134,163,175,27,73,86,120,22,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
