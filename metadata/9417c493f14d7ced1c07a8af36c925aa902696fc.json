I also include a noobs guid to instalation with common mistakes noob pirates make and simple instructions to get you playing like a pro pirate in no time. If the file says (By Mournfel) on the end of it you know its 100% functional. \n\nI also have Deuse Ex - Invisible Wars out and soon Morrowind Game of the year edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9417c493f14d7ced1c07a8af36c925aa902696fc","amp;dn":"Fable+%2B+The+Lost+Chapters+%28By+Mournfel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9417c493f14d7ced1c07a8af36c925aa902696fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,23,196,147,241,77,124,237,28,7,168,175,54,201,37,170,144,38,150,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
