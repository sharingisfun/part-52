No biggie, shit happens, but I was badly smacked by xenobytes members calling me names, discussing my mother, relatives and so on for no reason at all.  \n \nI didn\\&amp;#039;t say a word in local.  \n   \n Last week I was moving my cyno alt into Stain to move RA cap fleet into delve, was escorting poor kestrel with my main in rapier with cyno fitted.  \n \n Seven jumps away from destination, I jumped into  system, got lagged and died without loading grid(my connection sucks tbh). Checked killmail and wondered why is SE gang and MASS large warp disruptor on it, so I mailed my old friend thebold , asking \\&amp;#039;\\&amp;#039;WTF man???:) \\&amp;#039;\\&amp;#039;    \n \n In reply he sent me an evemail and compensation for my rapier apologising for it loss and told me that SE and COVEN  are about to finish off MASS pos in this system and it was just bad karma for me jumping there,  30 min before or 30 min later would be a clear way.  \n \n The plan quickly formed in my head, so I convoed thebold  and asked him to let this pos die. Next POS was anchored later same day.\n   \n Yesterday I got evemail from boldie, with date, system, planet ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ moon and time POS is out of reinforced. Cynos where already in place...  \n \nToday DT.  \n Cap gang formed, first cyno, jumping, recharged cap, the second cyno was in stain , so we waited 2 jumps away. At the same time COVEN warped their dreads to a grid loading point, 300 km away and started to allign towards POS, around 10 dreds in total.  \n \n 12 MASS carriers kept on  repping shields and when COVEN dreds warp towards POS, they got swarmed with fighters. 2 min later a naglfar was reported in deep structure, fight was getting more and more intence and I was thinking about leeving COVEN alone to die and waiting for another chance to bait SE caps, when out of the sudden cyno went on and SE nyx class mothership piloted by subzerodamage escorted by dozen of SE/COVEN  carriers jumped into system and engaged MASS carriers.  \n \n Mid cyno up, dock, undock - and we jump into the fight 5-10 km from Nyx, it was bubbled at least with 3-4 diktor bubbles and bumped by friendlies and RA caps.  \n \n Focus fire on nyx, melting fast with no friendly carriers trying to rep him, every one of  them was trying to get out, going down one by one, each melting in less then a minute.  \n \n SE bs fleet warped in at 150 , but it was already too late...   \n \n-Mothership (Nyx) \n-naglfar/moros/moros/revelation/phoenix \n-thanatos/chimera/chimera/archon \n-few battleships \n \n I want to give out a special thankyou to: thebold , all MASS dictor pilots, that was some best  \nbubbling/tackling I ever seen, very coordinated and professional. Big GRATZ from all RA cap  \nfleet pilots, you guys made it happen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af4f5bc95161a7150377fbe2cf70a2cb02272a08","amp;dn":"RA%2BMASS+kill+SE+Nyx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af4f5bc95161a7150377fbe2cf70a2cb02272a08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,79,91,201,81,97,167,21,3,119,251,226,207,112,162,203,2,39,42,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
