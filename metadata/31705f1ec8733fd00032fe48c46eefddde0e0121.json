It's KHONNOR here. I'm a kid from Vermont who is \nswamped with homework and school! I'm really looking \nforward to college! My musical interests cover a broad\nrange of styles, and I think this comes through in my \nmusic. I try to capture as much emotion as I can in the\nmusic that I make. Laugh. Cry. Tinkle. This is what i \nwant you to feel from this Khonnor Experience! The \nstory behind I, Cactus is very interesting. I, Cactus\nis from northern Ireland. As a child I, Cactus had no \nidea of the magical systems and televisions that were \nto be invented in the next few years. Throughout the \nprolific career of I, Cactus as a musician, I, Cactus \nworked with many bands, and experimented with unique \nsongmaking techniques. I, Cactus was born with a rare \ndisorder which causes colors to be seen specific to \nkeys and tones in the musical scale. The work of I, \nCactus is the result of experimentation in expanding \nthe field of 8bit aesthetics. I, Cactus is getting \ncaught up on all that was missed during childhood, \nand has only recently discovered computers and console \nentertainment systems. I, Cactus is over 79 years old.\n\n\nI, CACTUS \n---------\nhttp://www.8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php?artist=I%2C%20Cactus#8BP033\n\nThe deliciously delayed debut release from I, Cactus brings\nyou a short collection of sweet tunes filled with \nheartbreakingly innocent melodies. As you stroll along with\nthe sun at your back, one cute cactus after another \nbouncing happily behind you, with this carefree blend of \nchippy harmonies and clicky crunchy beats you'll never look\nat a cactus the same way again. Featuring such treasures \nas &quot;Bamboo Cactus&quot; an unforgettable remix of Nullsleep's \n&quot;Playful Panda&quot; - this little cactus packs a big punch!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31705f1ec8733fd00032fe48c46eefddde0e0121","amp;dn":"I%2C+Cactus+AKA+Khonnor+-+I%2C+Cactus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31705f1ec8733fd00032fe48c46eefddde0e0121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,112,95,30,200,115,63,208,0,50,254,72,196,110,239,221,222,14,1,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
