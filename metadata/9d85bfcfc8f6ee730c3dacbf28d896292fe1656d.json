Something everyone should have in their collection.\n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nCreepshow:\n\nFive tales of terror are presented in the gothic style of the old EC comics such as Tales From The Crypt and The Haunt of Fear. The first deals with a demented old man returning from the grave to get the Father's Day cake his murdering daughter never gave him. The second is about a not-too-bright farmer discovering a meteor that turns everything into plant-life. The third is about a vengeful husband burying his wife and her lover up to their necks on the beach. The fourth is about a creature that resides in a crate under the steps of a college. The final story is about an ultra-rich businessman who gets his comeuppance from cockroaches.\n\nCreepshow 2:\n\nThe EC Comics return with three tales. The first, an Indian comes to life... to kill for revenge of his elderly owners. The second, four teens are stranded on a raft on a lake with a blob who is hungry. And the third a hit and run woman is terrorized by the hitchhiker she accidently killed... or did she really kill him?\n\n----\n\nCreepshow:\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.0.1\nBitrate: 683 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x352 = 1.82:1\nAudio: English, 128 kb/s VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 02:00:22\nFPS: 23.976\n\nCreepshow 2:\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.0.1\nBitrate: 962 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x352 = 1.82:1\nAudio: English, 128 kb/s VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 01:29:28\nFPS: 23.976","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d85bfcfc8f6ee730c3dacbf28d896292fe1656d","amp;dn":"Creepshow_1_And_2+%28xvid101-sickboy88%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d85bfcfc8f6ee730c3dacbf28d896292fe1656d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,133,191,207,200,246,238,115,12,61,172,191,40,216,150,41,47,225,101,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
