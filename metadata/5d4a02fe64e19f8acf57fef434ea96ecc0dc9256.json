It is simply titled Demo Anno and was released in 2003.  There are other demos out there but unfortunately I don&amp;#039;t have them.  This is in MP3 format and 192kbps.  \n\nDemiricous are a death/thrash metal band out of Indianapolis, Indiana. Within a couple of months of forming, guitarist Ben Parrish (formerly of Upheaval on Willowtip Records) joined the band and they began to take their project more seriously. In 2005, they self-released a demo which caught the attention of Metal Blade.\n\nTheir debut album, One (Hellbound) was recorded and mixed at Planet-Z Studios with Zeuss (Hatebreed, The Red Chord, Shadows Fall) in June 2005 and released later that year. Following this the band set out on a tour with Himsa in late 2006.\n\nIt has also been stated that the bands name, Demiricous, has no significant meaning at all and is just a made up word. The band have already gained a worldwide fanbase with their debut album, and have earned the respect and praise of metal icons Slayer.\n\nTheir follow-up album, Two (Poverty), was released in 2007.\n\nTrack List:\n1) Crucifice\n2) March of the Heartattacks\n3) If the Shoe Fits... Destroy It\n4) In Being\n\nEnjoy and PLEASE SEED!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d4a02fe64e19f8acf57fef434ea96ecc0dc9256","amp;dn":"Demiricous+-+Demo+Anno+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d4a02fe64e19f8acf57fef434ea96ecc0dc9256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,74,2,254,100,225,159,138,207,87,254,244,52,234,150,236,192,220,146,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
