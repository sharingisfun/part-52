The series was previewed with a #0 in October, 2005, formally launched with #1 in January 2006 and ended with #6 in July.\n\nWritten by long-time Transformers writer Simon Furman, it is a new origin for the Generation 1 Transformers. The element of disguise is a major focus, as the Transformers have been living unnoticed amongst humans for several years. Their first contact with humans on Earth is chronicled in this series. Most of the Transformers have updated alternate modes of current vehicles, although recognizable due to paint schemes similar to their original incarnations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f14d9cb2c145cee938b4299178c610c116a5551b","amp;dn":"Transformers+Generation+One+-+Infiltration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f14d9cb2c145cee938b4299178c610c116a5551b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,77,156,178,193,69,206,233,56,180,41,145,120,198,16,193,22,165,85,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
