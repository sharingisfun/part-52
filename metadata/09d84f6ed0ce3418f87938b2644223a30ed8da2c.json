More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\n\nLast week I covered the painting tools, today I tackle the brushes that are needed for the paint tools.\n\nThere are different types of brushes and IÃƒÂ¢??ll show how to use them and how to create some of them. There are a lot of different brushes on the net for downloading, youÃƒÂ¢??ll find out how to make them available in your GIMP brush collection.\n\nIn the time since I recorded this show I found out how to make an ÃƒÂ¢??Image HoseÃƒÂ¢?? or animated brush. ItÃƒÂ¢??s not as complicated as the manual promises. Since itÃƒÂ¢??s nothing a photographer would use a lot, I am not sure if it fits into the show. If you want to see it, drop me a mail.\n\nAnd a warning: I recorded this with ÃƒÂ¢??recordmydesktopÃƒÂ¢?? - there are some parts where the audio and video is badly out of sync. It doesnÃƒÂ¢??t happen in a predictable way and I could not make it better during editing. The future shows will be again recorded with demorecorder - without that problem.
