The music is a mix of old styled heavy metal like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest with more modern styles like Power Metal and Progressive Metal. They are also very influenced by symphony music, especially filmscores. A few of the songs on Atlantis are almost entirely symphonic, which makes it a quite variated album. The lyrics are also pretty variated except that most songs share a specific theme, which is that of the future.\n\nCurrent Line-up:\n\nAnders Thonander - Bass, Keyboard, Programming\nOlivier Laroche - Guitars\nStefan Kolev - Vocals\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
