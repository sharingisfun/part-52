Patrolling this vast area was the job of U.S. Marshal Jim Crown (Stuart Whitman). Crown, who worked out of Cimarron City, was assigned no deputies, so he often counted on grizzled Scotsman MacGregor (Percy Herbert), green photographer Francis (Randy Boone) or cute hotel owner Dulcey (Jill Townsend) for help\n\n103. BROKEN WING  (9/21/1967)\nThere is trouble in Cimarron when Jing McQueen, the drunken and simple-minded son of wealthy cattleman Mike McQueen, shoots a local preacher and burns down a livery stable. When the preacher recovers, he refuses to press charges, and McQueen is released from jail, leaving Marshal Crown to control an angry lynch mob.\n  Guest stars: Karl Swenson (Dr. Kihlgren) , Al Wyatt Sr. (Case), Joel Fluellen (Railroad Porter), Steve Forrest (Wiley Harper), Larry Gates (Kilgallon), Pat Hingle (Mike McQueen), Arch Johnson (Parson Endicott), Tim O&amp;#039;Kelly (Jing McQueen), Warren Vanders (Thatch), Royal Dano (Matthew Mark Lukenjohn), Harry Harvey, Sr. (Railroad Agent) \n\nXviD/640x464/23.97fps\nmp3/44.1kHz/128kbps/71min\n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like to see more! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d6d03dd6320cd0fad6e6013dc5637dbee6a3cc","amp;dn":"CIMARRON+STRIP+103+Broken+Wing+%5Bretr0tv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d6d03dd6320cd0fad6e6013dc5637dbee6a3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,214,208,61,214,50,12,208,250,214,230,1,61,197,99,125,190,230,163,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
