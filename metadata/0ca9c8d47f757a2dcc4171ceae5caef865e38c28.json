His first solo album following the release of his EP a while back. If you like it, go buy it! I&amp;#039;m putting this up here to spread his music because I&amp;#039;m pretty sure he cares more about being heard then getting paid. \n\nIf you want me to seed, drop a comment or send an e-mail... I&amp;#039;d be more than happy to!\n\nThanks, Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca9c8d47f757a2dcc4171ceae5caef865e38c28","amp;dn":"Raine+Maida+-+The+Hunters+Lullaby+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ca9c8d47f757a2dcc4171ceae5caef865e38c28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,169,200,212,127,117,122,45,204,65,113,206,174,92,174,248,101,227,140,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
