One of the fastest growing podcasts. For those not familar with TWiT it's a bunch of geek exiles from America's G4 computer game cable channel. Entertaining and informative. This week some regulars are on vacation but this one is still pretty good.\n\nIf The Pirate Bay lacks seed (likely) you can pick up the torrent at http://feeds.feedburner.com/twit-hib. I'm just spreading the word!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a0518f9d7f1912d05f75b1467ed20ea70be5355","amp;dn":"This+Week+In+Tech+%28TWiT%29+podcast+%2312+-+7%2F7%2F2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a0518f9d7f1912d05f75b1467ed20ea70be5355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,5,24,249,215,241,145,45,5,247,91,20,103,237,32,234,112,190,83,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
