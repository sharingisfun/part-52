The concert features songs from the band&amp;#039;s recently released &quot;Home for Christmas&quot; album on their own U-Watch/DKE Records label, distributed by ICON Music Entertainment Services, giving fans a version of the current tour, which started Nov. 30th in Chicago and runs through December 17th in Philadelphia.\n\n&quot;Musically, it&amp;#039;s amazing, it really came out fantastic,&quot; says Daryl of the performance. &quot;We decorated the big room with a Christmas tree and all the trimmings. Anybody that doesn&amp;#039;t get a chance to see the live show can catch it online. From a technical standpoint, it&amp;#039;s going to be even better than the first one.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d85e03ca09b643a62c04cbe6006213bde2925fd4","amp;dn":"Daryl+Hall+-Live+from+Daryl%5C%27s+House+Part+2.WebRip.%5BPSoul%5D.mov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d85e03ca09b643a62c04cbe6006213bde2925fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,94,3,202,9,182,67,166,44,4,203,230,0,98,19,189,226,146,95,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
