The intro has also be changed.\n\nTammany Hall NYC is a band somewhat akin to The Shins.  \\&quot;Cindy\\&quot; has been used in one or two movies and an episode of Scrubs.\n\nI remixed the song simply because I like it and felt it lacked some filler.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c865b97d17b01f592c6242d53a4554a4c00d027b","amp;dn":"Cindy+-+Tammany+Hall+NYC+-+PsychoBunny+Remix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c865b97d17b01f592c6242d53a4554a4c00d027b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,101,185,125,23,176,31,89,44,98,66,213,58,69,84,164,192,13,2,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
