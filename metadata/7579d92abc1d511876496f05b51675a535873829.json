Swedish _and_ english sound, with subtitles of course!\n        What? 899kbps seems low? Well, not really. The QF is still \n        close to 0.2 and due to the simplicity of the cartoon itself \n        -- complexity not always being a guarantee for success ;) -- \n        this little baby still rocks!. That extra ~100 kpbs that others\n        throw in really does not make much of difference, especially\n        not if the resolution is in the lower range, and as such, does \n        not zoom very nicely. Also, most versions circulating is at an\n        exact 2.40:1. That, according to us, being ~3% off the &quot;real&quot; AR\n        after full cropping has been applied.\n        End credits as always with lowered quantizer in favour for the\n        main movie pixels.\n        Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7579d92abc1d511876496f05b51675a535873829","amp;dn":"The.Simpsons.Movie.2007.SWEDiSH.iNTERNAL.MULTi.AUDiO.DVDRiP.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7579d92abc1d511876496f05b51675a535873829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,121,217,42,188,29,81,24,118,73,111,5,181,22,117,165,53,135,56,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
