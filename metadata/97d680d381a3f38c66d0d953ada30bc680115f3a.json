Now I&amp;#039;ll confess straight up that I loathe romantic comedies, and while I love a good thriller, there have been few lately that really stand out. Most either ask you to believe the unbelievable, or have about three tag endings. You know the kind where the baddie just won&amp;#039;t die and the main characters do dumb things like turn their back on the &amp;#039;body&amp;#039;. Urgh! So lame! Thankfully, The Unsaid doesn&amp;#039;t let itself fall into that trap, and ends up being a fair effort.\n\nMichael Hunter (Andy Garcia) is a psychologist still dealing with the grief and guilt of his son&amp;#039;s suicide. His wife, Penny (Chelsea Field), is no longer a part of his life, and his daughter, Shelley (Linda Cardellini), who lives with his ex-wife, is slowly drifting away from him.\n\nWhen a former student, Barbara Wagner (Teri Polo), asks him to look into a case she is involved in, he reluctantly agrees when he realises how much the boy, Thomas Caffey (Vincent Kartheiser), reminds him of his dead son, Kyle (Trevor Blumas). Thomas has been in care since being found at the family home four years previous alongside the body of his mother, murdered by his father. Barbara believes there is real pain and hidden trauma in Thomas, and is concerned he is not ready for release from his carer institution in a few weeks when he turns 18.\n\nAÃƒâ€˜O: 2001\n\nDIRECTOR: Tom McLoughlin\n\nINTÃƒâ€°RPRETES: Andy Garcia (Michael Hunter), Vincent Kartheiser (Thomas &amp;#039;Tommy&amp;#039; Caffey), Teri Polo (Barbara Wagner), Linda Cardellini (Shelly Hunter), Sam Bottoms (Joseph Caffey), August Schellenberg (Detective Hannah), Chelsea Field (Penny), Brendan Fletcher (Troy), Trevor Blumas (Kyle Huntyer)\n\nDURACIÃƒâ€œN: 108 minutos\n\nGÃƒâ€°NERO: Drama\n\nVideo Pal\nWidescreen 16:9\nLanguages DTS: Spanish .
