The blurry picture and the not-so-good visual quality has \nnothing to do with the digitalization of the movie. It was already blurry on the VHS. \nAnd lets not forget who held the camera...\n\nSpecial thanks to the person who digitalized the movie, and the morons who taped it in \nthe first place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e886ee13f783ac4c71a91eace6322f127876b1","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Nazi+Camp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e886ee13f783ac4c71a91eace6322f127876b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,232,134,238,19,247,131,172,76,113,169,30,172,230,50,47,18,120,118,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
