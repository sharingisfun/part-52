Waking hours is their second album. \nIt came out in 1989 and is a good place to start from when exploring their music.\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 - Kiss This Thing Goodbye\n02 - Opposite View\n03 - Move Away Jimmy Blue\n04 - Stone Cold Sober\n05 - You're Gone\n06 - When I Want You\n07 - This Side of the Morning\n08 - Empty\n09 - Hatful of Rain\n10 - Nothing Ever Happens\n\nIf I see an interest I will put up more of their music.\nPlease, if you like them buy their albums. \nJustin Currie is worth supporting as he is currently working on his first solo album.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c99f3527251b1288cc002b0fc952d276f8778783","amp;dn":"Del+Amitri+-+Waking+Hour+%281989%29+-+192kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c99f3527251b1288cc002b0fc952d276f8778783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,159,53,39,37,27,18,136,204,0,43,15,201,82,210,118,248,119,135,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
