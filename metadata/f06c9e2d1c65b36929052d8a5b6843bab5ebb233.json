There will also \nbe an install of a complete Virtual C drive and a virtual Eeprom. The virtual C will be set up with an unmodded MSdashboard \nso it can be used without problems. The Virtual files are hidden on the real C drive and cannot easily be altered or deleted.\nThe Ndure exploit has the ability to load up to a stock state by using the eject button from where you could launch a retail\ngame and access live. However you will have no access to any network settings or the live dashboard in this state.\nIf you do want Live dashboard access you can switch the mod off temporary using this exploit.\nYou could also launch retail games by loading them from bootup and access live that way. \nEither way of going live you are always able to receive game updates.\n\nhttp://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=430898&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=2842362\n\n\nI can understand this readme is a bit long so I will put *****'s above and beneath the lines EVERYBODY should read before \nusing this installer.\n\n\n\n\nFirst:\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\nThe installer only works on dashboard version 5960 (current latest dashboard). You can check your dashboard version by going\ninto the settings tab and select system info. Watch the D: number on the bottom of the screen beneath the scrolling text.\nIf the dashboard is too low you can upgrade by accessing the live tab in a recent Xbox live game or by connecting to the live\nserver.\n\nAlso the installer might not function properly if there are leftovers from previous exploits on the C partition. It will \nhowever not interfere with folders like apps and games.\n\nThe Installer will backup the C partition of your Xbox in the installation process. Therefore it's needed to have at least\n200 MB of free space on the E partition (12,800 blocks). This should normally be available with any Xbox but some people like\nto fill up their entire harddrive with songs or downloadable content. When doubting check the memory tab.\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\nInstallation:\nThe saves come zipped up for direct use on Action Replay devices. If you don't use Action replay you need to unzip first.\nNote that many Action Replay cards corrupt large saves which results in a black or error 21 screen. Solution would be to use\na small gamesave exploit to grant access to the hd and copy this save to the E:UDATA folder via ftp. Or use another memory\ncard.\n\nCopy the save to the Xbox HD using the known ways. (via memory unit, USB device or hotswap) \nLoad the save through the exploited game and follow the on screen instructions.\nThe user is forced to first select the eeprom backup function prior to the installation.\n\n\n\nMain setup screen:\nThese options become available by entering the installer the first time:\n\n\nBackup eeprom:\n\nYou can use this to create an eeprom backup without having to install the whole softmod. Remember in order to return the Xbox\nto its original state you need to remove the eeprom backup. You can use the remove eeprom backup function to do this.\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\n!!!You need to backup the eeprom before you install the softmod!!!\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\n\nInstall Softmod:\n\nThis is the option to install the Ndure softmod. You will be prompted throughout the install to select whether to install \nNkpatcher.06 or .67 (select the help file in case you don't know what this means). Also a choice of dashboard has to be made\nChoices are Evolution X or UnleashX. The dashboard can be replaced afterwards to any dashboard you like.\n\n\nRestore from rescue disc:\n\nYou can use this option if the Xbox won't boot up properly anymore without retail discs inside and you want to restore. You\nneed to enter your kernel version to use this option. If you don't know your kernel you should choose &quot;generic&quot;.\nMore information about the rescue disc later on in this readme.\n\n\nSwitch menu:\n\nThis option is for those that removed or messed up their save after installing the softmod and want to return to the modded\nmenu. This should not be used if you didn't already install this softmod.\n\n\nSettings:\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\nThis is for people who would like to adjust their network settings or screen calibration. Remember when you ftp in from this\nscreen there are no virtual protections so be aware.\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\n\n\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\nModded menu:\nThese options become available after the mod. You need to load this through your exploitable game if you want to enter this\nmenu for the first time.\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\n\nSwitch softmod on/off:\n\nWith this option you can switch the softmod off so you boot to a retail state. In this state you have full live dashboard\noptions. There will still be modded files on the hd so don't use this if you want to revert your Xbox to stock.\n\n\nRemove softmod:\nThis option is divided in two:\n\n-Restore from HD backup:\nThis will restore your system from a backup made automatically in the install process. This backup is located in \nE:backupsC drive\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\nDO NOT SELECT THIS OPTION IF NO SUCH DIRECTORY EXITS ON YOUR E DRIVE OR YOU CHANGED THE CONTENTS.\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\n\n-Restore from Rescue disc:\nThis will restore from a pre-made rescue disc. e.g. when the HD backup is missing. You need to enter your kernel version to \nuse this option. If you don't know your kernel you should choose &quot;generic&quot;. \nMore information about the rescue disc later on in this readme.\n\n\nRestore MSdash after dashupdate:\n\nThis option will restore your MSdash after a dashupdate in dual-retail or in switched off mode. Only use this if your\nMSdash is infunctional in dual-retail or switched off mode.\n\n\nExtras:\nThis option has all the goodies inside which you could optionally use to personalize/configure your softmod.\n\nMultiboot:\nThere are several multi boot options. I will explain each one of them.\n--dual retail: This will let you boot to your MSdash when powering on with the eject button. In this state you can safely \n  access live.\n--dual save: This will let you boot to this menu when powering on with the eject button.\n--dual altdash: This will let you boot to an alternative dashboard when powering on with the eject button. After selecting\n  You can put a dashboard inside E:dashboardaltdash (folder is created automatically). \n--tri save: same as dual save but now with tri boot. Tri boot let's you insert a disc after powering on with the eject button\n  and automatically closes the tray. If there's a disc in it will boot the disc. If not it will boot the save.\n  The disc must be signed with the habibi key. The rescue disc is pre- signed. Remember that when accessing the Xbox from \n  within the disc or the save there are no virtual protections.\n--tri altdash: same as dual altdash but this time with tri-boot. (see option above).\n\nInstall DVDX2:\nThis will install an Xbox DVD movie player. The dashboard is preconfigured to use it right away.\n\nVGA options:\nThree options are available:\n--SoG: This patches the kernel video output to VGA SoG signal.\n--Progressive: This patches the kernel to change video mode to 480p whenever application requests 480i mode.\n--Disable VGA: This will return the video output to normal.\nThe VGA will work on both the normal and the alternative dashboard. Be aware that this functions might not work with some \ngames.\n\nFormat F drive:\nThis formats the f partition. \n\nTweak fonts:\nIf you sometimes experience boot problems (stuck at logo screen with white text) you could fix that by setting a kernel\nspecific font. This requires you to select the right kernel version.\n\nClear cache:\nSometimes the cache can't do its job anymore cuz it's filled with interfering and/or write protected files.\nThis will result in games not loading or hanging. This option will take care off that.\n(cache is cleared automatically while installing also)\n\nend of extras\n\n\n\nSettings:\n\nThis is for people who would like to adjust their network settings or screen calibration. Remember when you ftp in from this\nscreen there are no virtual protections so be aware.\n\nend of modded menu\n\n\n\nCouple of things you should know:\n\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\nThe default network settings is set to DHCP (automatic receive IP from router). If you don't have a router or just wish to \nhave a static IP you need to adjust that in BOTH the dashboard and the installer menu otherwise it won't be active on retail\n(cold)boots and you won't be able to log into live.\n\nThe exploited save itself belongs on the hd at any time. It's an important safety backdoor for when anything goes wrong and \nit will save you from (hot)swapping your hd. So therefore it's recommended to not delete it.\n\nIt is very recommended to copy the eeprom backup to the pc and keep it safe as soon as possible.\n*****************************************************************************************************************************\n\nYou can replace the dashboard to any dash you like by replacing the files in the E:dashboard folder. Make sure its xbe is\nnamed default.xbe. In case this goes wrong it will boot to the installer's menu instead. In case that isn't present also it\nwill boot to a rescue dashboard located on the real C (thus hidden). In this dashboard you have very limited options.\n(only a launch disc and settings options to adjust ftp settings).\n\n\n\n\nRescue Disc:\n\nThis may be nice to recover from messed up systems (or even to set up bigger hd's). \nIn your rescue disc folder you will find three folders which you can use to put files in:\n\nC drive: In this folder you should put the files you wish to use to replace the C contents. This could either be stock files\n(from HD backup, slayer's AID disc etc.) or it could be modded files (gathered from pc backups in modded state).\n\nE drive: In this folder you should put the files you wish to use to replace the E contents. This could either be stock files\n(savegame folders: TDATA and UDATA) or it could be modded files (gathered from pc backups in modded state).\n\nDashboard: In this folder you could put a dashboard in case the dashboard on the Xbox is gone or damaged. the dashboard \nfolder on E will be replaced by the dashboard folder on this disc. You can put any dashboard in here as long as it's \nexecutable is named default.xbe\n\n\nSo basically:\n\n\nTo recover to stock:\n\nPut stock files in C drive folder.\n\nFill the E drive folder with the UDATA and TDATA backups from your Xbox. If you didn't back them up you could try to get ftp \naccess prior to using this option and ftp over the UDATA and TDATA folder from your Xbox. If you don't have or want any \nbackups you could just leave the UDATA and TDATA folders empty. There should be no folders other then TDATA and UDATA present\nif you are reverting to stock.\n\nIn the disc menu choose the restore system option.\n\n\nTo recover to modded state:\n\nPut full C drive backup from modded unprotected state in C drive folder. (You can get the full C drive files by ftping in \nfrom the gamesave installer's menu).\n\nPut full E drive backup in E drive folder.\n\nIn the disc menu choose the restore system option.\n\n\nTo recover dashboard\n\nPut dashboard in dashboard folder. (dash's xbe named default.xbe)\n\nIn the disc menu choose the restore dashboard option.\n\n\nSetting the network settings: (in case you want ftp access)\n\nYou will have to do this prior to burning the disc because they can't be edited while running from disc. Default is set to DHCP.\nTo do this open the xml file and edit the network settings to your likings.\n\n\n\nBurning the disc:\n\nMake an Xbox iso from the Rescue disc folder. You can use any Xbox image creator app for this. \nI prefer Qwix (http://www.teamavalaunch.com/qwix/).\nThen burn the iso as an image using any disc burning app.\n!!!Make sure you use discs you know your Xbox can read!!!\n\n\n\nThat?s all ;)\n\n\nThanks to everybody supporting me and my previous installers. If it wasn't for the great responses I wouldn't have made this\none. \n\nSpecial thanks to the coders, tools producers and other people involved in making the exploits to the stable standard of \nmodding it is now.(The xbox-linux crew, Rmenhal, Angerwound, Pedrospad, Devz3ro, ldots, dr oldschool, xman954, DaddyJ, \nTriggernum5, kingroach, Eh, Cio and anyone else I might have forgotten).\n\nMore thanks to all the peeps visiting the Exploits forums on a regular base and share their knowledge with others.\n\n\n\nHave fun\n\n\n\n-Krayzie-\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f06c9e2d1c65b36929052d8a5b6843bab5ebb233","amp;dn":"Krayzie+SC+NTSC+Ndure+Installer+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f06c9e2d1c65b36929052d8a5b6843bab5ebb233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,108,158,45,28,101,179,105,41,5,45,138,91,104,67,186,181,235,178,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
