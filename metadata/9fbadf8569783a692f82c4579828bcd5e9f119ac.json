It is the story of the life of the intellectual Winston Smith, his job in the Ministry of Truth, and his degradation by the totalitarian government of Oceania, the country in which he lives. It has been translated into sixty-two languages, and has deeply impressed itself in the English language. Nineteen Eighty-Four, its terms and language, and its author are bywords in discussions of personal privacy and state security. The adjective &quot;Orwellian&quot; describes actions and organizations characteristic of Oceania, the totalitarian society depicted in the novel, and the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; refers to invasive surveillance.\n\n\nPlease seed 1:1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fbadf8569783a692f82c4579828bcd5e9f119ac","amp;dn":"George+Orwell+-+1984","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fbadf8569783a692f82c4579828bcd5e9f119ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,186,223,133,105,120,58,105,47,130,196,87,152,40,188,213,233,241,25,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
