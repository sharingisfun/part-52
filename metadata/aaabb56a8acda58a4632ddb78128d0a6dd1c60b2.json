It also includes and updater so that in the future, it can be used to get the newest. Pacsteam is a cracked steam that allows you to install many games for free. \n\nIMPORTANT INFO ABOUT PacSteam BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE:\nDo NOT use your legit steam accounts on PacSteam - ONLY use Blank / Empty accounts !!!\n\n!!! Cracked VAC2 works, and legit servers too SOMETIMES !!!\n\nThis is the list of the games that CAN be downloaded with PacSteam:\n\nArx Fatalis\nAstroPop Deluxe\nBejeweled 2 Deluxe\nBejeweled Deluxe\nBookworm Adventure Deluxe\nBigMoney Deluxe\nBookworm Deluxe\nChuzzle Deluxe\nCodename Gordon\nCondition Zero (Playable on &quot;SteamBuster&quot;)\nCounter-Strike\nCounter-Strike: Source\nDark Messiah\nDay of Defeat\nDay of Defeat: Source\nDeathmatch Classic\nDefcon\nDynomite Deluxe\nEets\nFeeding Frenzy 2 Deluxe\nHalf-Life\nHalf-Life 2\nHalf-Life 2: Deathmatch\nHammer Heads Deluxe\nHeavy Weapon Deluxe\nIggle Pop Deluxe\nInsaniquarium Deluxe\nOpposing Force\nPizza Frenzy Deluxe\nPoker Superstars II\nRace - the WTCC Game\nRag Doll Kung Fu\nRed Orchestra: Ostfront\nRicochet\nRicochet: Lost Worlds\nRoboBlitz\nRocket Mania Deluxe\nTalismania Deluxe\nTeam Fortress Classic\nTyper Shark Deluxe\nWik and the fable of souls\nZen of Sudoku\nZuma Deluxe\n\nIMPORTANT About &quot;Steam Buster&quot;:\n\n1) When starting &quot;Steam Buster&quot; up the first time, press &quot;Files&quot;, &quot;Settings&quot;\n. . .and mark the &quot;Use with STEAM client&quot; and press &quot;ok&quot;\n\n2) Press the &quot;Browse...&quot; bottom, and select the &quot;SteamApps&quot; folder\n\n3) Next you press &quot;Files&quot;, &quot;Change User&quot;, enter the account info and press\n. . .&quot;ok&quot; and you are ready to go !!!\n\nSteamBuster\nHow to play EXPIRED GCFs on PacSteam\n\nUse Steam Buster to play ALL your expired GCFs !!! If a game wont start, just right-click on the game\nin SteamBuster and press &quot;Delete game (Without GCF)&quot;. Start up the game, and just let Steam Buster\nunpack the GCF again.... Then the game WILL work just fine even without an updated GCF Wink\n\nHow do I use PacSteam !??\n\n* Download and install the latest PacSteam Setup.\n\n* Install the PacSteam Setup ( Do NOT remove your SteamApps folder if it already exists,\notherwise the games will not work when you move the steamapps folder back. )\n\n* Run the AutoUpdator and update with the latest patches, fixes etc.\n\n* When the PacSteam Update becomes too big and buggy, I will pack another PacSteam Setup for you\nto download and install. Just remember the most safe way is to run the Un-Installer of PacSteam first,\nand again; do NOT move your steamapps folder or anything. No games will be deleted and your\nsettings and account information will still be there.\n\n* To prevent people from having trouble logging into servers, the Seti Master Servers are now a part\nof PacSteam as standard, but there are still many more servers to play on, so in order to get the full\nserver list from steam, simply run the UNDO patch.\n\n* Since many also have a legit steam account, but isnt going to use it on cracked steam because that\nwill only get it disabled at some point, there are now a &quot;cracked&quot; and &quot;legit&quot; steam patch to be able to\nswitch quickly betwine cracked and legit steam. This way you wont have too install steam 2 times on your\nPC.
