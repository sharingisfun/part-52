The tyrant-approved message today is one which my book,\n&quot;How To Be a Successful Tyrant,&quot; specifically talks about: the\nnotion that the government is allowed to use violence however it\npleases, but it is unforgivable for the peasants to even vaguely\nsuggest forcible resistance.\n\nVarious state-worshippers such as Glen Beck have decided to paint\nRon Paul supporters as terrorists. And it&amp;#039;s pretty darn obvious\nthat spreading this lie is a very premeditated, calculated move by\nthe tyrant mouthpieces. The following link will give you a story\nand videos all about it:\n\n[ http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/november2007/161107_beck_smears.htm ]\n\nPlease allow me to state the bleeding obvious: Ron Paul is trying\nto win an ELECTION, and the people who support his campaign are\nalso trying to make that happen. He is trying to use the system to\nachieve freedom. (I hate to be a party-pooper, but personally, I\nthink that in the long run, that is utterly impossible.) The fact\nthat some of his supporters organized a funding campaign on\nNovember 5th--the day Guy Fawkes tried to blow up parliament--\ndoesn&amp;#039;t make them terrorists.\n\nBut one line from Glen Beck&amp;#039;s smear piece made it sound like he&amp;#039;s\nbeen reading my book. Basically, he acknowledged that the\n&quot;government&quot; is corrupt, doesn&amp;#039;t do what the people want, etc., but\nfollowed that up by saying that us peasants are allowed to TALK\nabout that, but only a nasty &quot;terrorist&quot; would ever use VIOLENCE to\nresist it. (I guess that would include Jefferson, Washington, etc.)\n\nWhat do you think the feds do every DAY? They use violence for\nEVERYTHING they do. Who made up the rule that it&amp;#039;s okay for fascist\nthugs to use violence, but it&amp;#039;s not okay for their victims to\nforcibly resist them? For example, I believe that when the federal\nthugs were doing their armed robbery stunt of the Liberty Dollar\noffices recently, it would have been perfectly justifiable to use\nwhatever amount of force, including deadly force, necessary to\nrepel the thieves. Yes, I&amp;#039;m saying that gunning down the FBI and\nSecret Service fascists would have been ABSOLUTELY MORALLY\nJUSTIFIED.\n\nOf course, it would also be really dang dangerous, and in the long\nrun I can&amp;#039;t imagine it turning out well for those who resisted. So\nI&amp;#039;m not saying they should have, but I AM saying that they had\nevery right to. Yes, I realize that&amp;#039;s an &quot;extremist&quot; viewpoint,\nwhich, in a land of obedient pansies, makes most people wet their\npants. Too bad. And being someone who DOES believe that forcible\nresistance to tyranny is a good thing, I am in a position to tell\nyou that that is NOT what the Ron Paul campaign is advocating.\n\nRather than writing it all over again, allow me to quote myself.\nThe following is an excerpt from &quot;How To Be a Successful Tyrant&quot; ( &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tyrantbook.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tyrantbook.com&lt;/a&gt; ). Remember, the book is written as if it\nis addressing aspiring tyrants. Read it, and see how good a job\nGlen Beck and the other statist apologists are doing following the\ntyrant blueprint.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nLarken Rose &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.larkenrose.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.larkenrose.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c85c51554fab094158a4f13e917dae144504e2e","amp;dn":"Ron+Paul%2C+FBI+Larken+Rose+2007-11-16+Good+Violence%2C+Bad+Violence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c85c51554fab094158a4f13e917dae144504e2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,133,197,21,84,250,176,148,21,138,79,19,233,23,218,225,68,80,78,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
