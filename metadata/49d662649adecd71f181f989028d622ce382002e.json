Released in 1992, its original French language title is C&amp;#039;est arrivÃƒÂ© prÃƒÂ¨s de chez vous (It Happened Close to Your House), which derives from the former title of the local daily news report in Belgian newspaper Le Soir.[citation needed] In the film, a crew of filmmakers follow a serial killer, recording his crimes and grotesquely candid commentary for a documentary they are producing. At first dispassionate observers, they find themselves caught up in the increasingly chaotic violence. The film is shot in black and white and was produced on a shoe-string budget by four student filmmakers, led by director RÃƒÂ©my Belvaux. The genesis of the idea came from shooting a documentary without any money. As the filming went on, the students were able to garner more support and ultimately find a distributor.
