Tim Robbins was removed from the movie. Also this edit contains a very different ending. This time we fight back.\n\n\nCuts removed/added/extended:\n\n   1. removed intro sequence and Morgan Freeman speech - we love MF but his speech was pathetic and too much 50s style. We want our movie to have a today feeling, no fairytale stuff and no envious aliens. Of course they want our planet, but they havenÃƒÂ¢??t been waiting and watching. We were just next on the list\n   2. Added ÃƒÂ¢??approaching earthÃƒÂ¢?? scene from Independence Day - it looks just better than the earth scene in Wotw\n   3. removed Ray racing through the streets when he is heading home - Tom Cruise showing off. No one would drive that way and risk his license like that. The scene was meant to introduce RayÃƒÂ¢??s character, but we do not want him like that. He is an asshole anyway.\n   4. removed Harlon completely from the movie - sorry Tim Robbins, you did not fit into our edition, we couldnÃƒÂ¢??t believe your madness and we definitely did not want Ray to kill you.\n   5. removed Ray arriving in Boston scene - there will be no Boston only as a dream of Ray.\n   6. removed soldiers fighting the tripods scenes - soldiers will never be able to battle the tripods and win.\n   7. removed people leaving the tunnel - the tunnel is not Greenbrier bunker facility in White Sulphur Springs but itÃƒÂ¢??s the ARK in Missouri and has just one exit.\n   8. added the ark scenes from Deep Impact - that is where Ray goes, that is where everybody goes who does not want to die.\n   9. added Nuclear War from Terminator 2 and Terminator 3 - our grande finale, making the earth unusable for anyone, even aliens\n  10. removed Morgan Freeman speech from the ending and played the final destruction shots vice versa - the first green seed is our first sign of life that is about to spread anew. Maybe some people are still alive\n  11. moved Boston from the end to after the credits - it is a dream of Ray, once to be a hero\n\nDVD - Features:\n\n   1. Language: English\n   2.

Now we kept the apocalypse and added some more. Our humans do strike back. Desperately. Tim Robbins was completely removed from the movie (which was tough work and there still are some scenes where you can see him if you really look). We also had to improve Rays character from being a complete loser to a caring dad, who would take his daughter to a refuge. Overall we added several scenes from different movies to make our ending possible. There are of course no aliens to be seen in these scenes, still they fit kind of well.\n\nMovies we used scenes from: Independence Day, Deep Impact, Terminator 2, Terminator 3\nMovies we used only sound from: Broken Arrow (explosions, shots fired), Con Air (coughing and helicopter), Jaws (screams, babbling), Man On Fire (traffic), The Rock (Rockets)\n\nTime needed for the edition\nplanning: 8 weeks\nediting: 3 days\nsound editing: 21 days\ntrailer: 1 day\nDVD layout and features: 3 days\npersons involved: 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9460a64a4abe9ba25d96db684ceab47552d6ec1","amp;dn":"War+Of+The+Worlds+-+The+Extinctive+Cut+by+CBB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9460a64a4abe9ba25d96db684ceab47552d6ec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,70,10,100,164,171,233,186,37,217,109,182,132,206,171,71,85,45,110,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
