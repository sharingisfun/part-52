For more on the bass manager also see the VST version. Please note we are working on a simple method for calibrating your 5.1 surround system in PPro.\n\nIt simulates the bass management systems found on most dolby digital and dts surround sound receivers. This allows surround sound engineers to hear what their 5.1 surround mix sounds like without having to burn a CDr or DVDr and then play it through a consumer 5.1 surround receiver. This plug-in is to be used for monitoring only. This means you turn off the plug-in when you render your main audio files.\n\nThere is a short tutorial on how to use the plug-in here: http://www.kellyindustries.com/articles/adobe_premiere_bass_management.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1206629109c211205eb9070931c23bc8dea1ee2f","amp;dn":"Adobe+Premiere+Bass+Manager+VST+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1206629109c211205eb9070931c23bc8dea1ee2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,6,98,145,9,194,17,32,94,185,7,9,49,194,59,200,222,161,238,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
