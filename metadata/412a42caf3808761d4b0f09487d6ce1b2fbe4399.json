I tried to keep all the imagery time-specific with the release of Paul&amp;#039;s Boutique--so nothing before July 25, 1989.\n\nNot all the video segments are exact matches to the lyrics, but they are poetic matches.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for better segments, contact me. All forms of media accepted: movies, television shows, magazines, newspaper photos, etc.\n\nPeace out,\nThe Kid from Kansas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412a42caf3808761d4b0f09487d6ce1b2fbe4399","amp;dn":"Beastie.Boys.High.Plains.Drifter.624X352.AC3.XVid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412a42caf3808761d4b0f09487d6ce1b2fbe4399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,42,66,202,243,128,135,97,212,176,240,148,135,214,206,27,47,190,67,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
