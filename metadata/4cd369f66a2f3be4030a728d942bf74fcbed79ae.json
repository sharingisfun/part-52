His job? Professional &quot;cleaner&quot;. Nothing too violent, just disposing of bodies. But in Brett Battles&amp;#039; electrifying debut novel, Quinn&amp;#039;s latest assignment will change everything.\n\nThe job seemed simple enough: investigating a suspicious case of arson. But when a dead body turns up, and Quinn&amp;#039;s handlers at &quot;the Office&quot; turn strangely silent, he knows he&amp;#039;s in over his head. With only a handful of clues, Quinn struggles to find out why someone wants him dead...and if it&amp;#039;s linked to a larger attempt to wipe out the Office.\n\nQuinn&amp;#039;s only hope may be Orlando, a woman from his past who may hold the key to solving the case. Suddenly, the two are prying into old crimes, crisscrossing continents, and struggling to stay alive. But as the hunt intensifies, Quinn is stunned by a chilling secret...and a brilliantly orchestrated conspiracy.\n\nFuriously paced, filled with superbly drawn characters and pitch-perfect dialogue, The Cleaner confirms Battles&amp;#039; place as one of the most exciting new talents in suspense fiction.\n\n\n\n             ****************************************************\n\n\n\nIf you like audio books please buy some.
