The boy, Tom Fitzsaxby, is an outcast with an English name at a Boer orphanage; his only friend, a black employee. When terrible events occur, Tom decides to fight for what is right. This is a tough book made manageable for listeners by the complex portrayal of characters and by a happy ending. Humphrey Bower paces the tension just right and relieves us with quick-step happiness when it appears. Throughout, he offers revealing, sometimes heartbreaking, portraits of little boys, Boer overseers, and black villagers in an exemplary performance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6acecf4df259b8bcfd03dccf839720e2754a5a","amp;dn":"Bryce+Courtenay+-+Whitethorn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6acecf4df259b8bcfd03dccf839720e2754a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,106,206,207,77,242,89,184,188,253,3,220,207,131,151,32,226,117,74,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
