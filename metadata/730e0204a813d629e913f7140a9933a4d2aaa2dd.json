Great Falls high school graduates Erik and Cooze are about to become college freshmen, and once they do, the campus of a modest Michigan college will never be the same. Immediately aligning themselves with the notorious Beta Delta Xi house, the boys dive headlong into the party scene while suddenly being swept up in an ongoing rivalry between their new brothers and a rival house with a power-hungry president. Now the only way for the Beta Delta Xi brothers to prove their true worth is to resurrect The Games - a long-banned competition that will discern the true kings of campus once and for all. Featuring Eugene Levy and Christopher McDonald.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:730e0204a813d629e913f7140a9933a4d2aaa2dd","amp;dn":"American+Pie+6+Beta+House+%5B2007%5D.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"730e0204a813d629e913f7140a9933a4d2aaa2dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,14,2,4,168,19,214,41,233,19,247,20,10,153,51,164,210,170,162,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
