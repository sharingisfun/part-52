This video had world premier. The presentation was held in a church especially renterd for this event.\n\nThe video costed slightly over 8 MSek to do. An enourmous amount in Sweden at that time.\n\n&quot;The Final Countdown&quot; is a 1986 hit single released by the Swedish glam metal band Europe. It was the first single released internationally from the album The Final Countdown, and was number 1 in 26 countries, selling more than 8 million copies worldwide.\n\nFor this video an adapted text was made, it was performed by Europe at this time when the hit was still at the top, and Europe was internationally the hottest Swedish Band around.\n\nYou can also see Mr. Ake Svantesson, the founder ad brain behind Svecia, popping in for a hello. He is missed by many, thank&amp;#039;s for your revolutionary ideas.\n\nWhat a waste....\n\nMaybe I&amp;#039;m just nostalgic, but I think this is hilarious. Just Fantastic!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b8e68eab08578ef4aa9f6022da59ad479e00455","amp;dn":"Svecia+Power+-+Reklam+Video+1986+-+performed+by+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b8e68eab08578ef4aa9f6022da59ad479e00455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,142,104,234,176,133,120,239,74,169,246,2,45,165,154,212,121,224,4,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
