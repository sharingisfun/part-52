Hosted by Steve Gibsion of GRC.com and Leo Laporte from Twit.tv. This is in a DVD ISO so just use any ISO reader to extract one episode or use any burner to burn to a DVD. Great idea is to use Spotlight (OS X) or another index service to search the disk for the episode topic you want, then use the file number to play it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f74e376fdf64e32d3e6cf6445607aa944b5a4eed","amp;dn":"Security+Now+Ep+1-127","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f74e376fdf64e32d3e6cf6445607aa944b5a4eed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,78,55,111,223,100,227,45,62,108,246,68,86,7,170,148,75,90,78,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
