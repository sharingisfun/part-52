It is based on a binaural field recording made by Swedish Musictrade artist Frags using Soundman OKM microphones. The field recording runs in real time as a background for the song, the underground stations with their recorded announcements establishing natural breakpoints for the flow of the music. There are numerous nationalities living in the southern suburbs of Stockholm, to be heard in the recording as a babelic mixture of languages.\n\nBoth a 24bit/88.2kHz audiophile version and a LAME HVBR mp3 version are included in this package.\n\n\nEnjoy,\n\nMusictrade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d17536e23d98475f90ad7121c8124aad1efd06e","amp;dn":"Doc+-+R%C3%B6da+Linjen+%5Bexp.+ambient%2C+24bit+FLAC+%2B+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d17536e23d98475f90ad7121c8124aad1efd06e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,23,83,110,35,217,132,117,249,10,215,18,28,129,36,170,209,239,208,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
