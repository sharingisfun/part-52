Instead of seeing text, you&amp;#039;ll see a thumbnail picture of the program, even before you do anything! This does not hog up cpu or ram like the one vista has. Available for xp and Vista home Basic (Since home basic vista doesn&amp;#039;t have this feature) \n\nJust unzip and install. \n\nPlease enjoy and comment! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccacdd7b9d42212e3bfa0f2a590be6eaffbfd8f2","amp;dn":"Visual+Task+Tips+%28For+those+who+want+Vista+features+without+the+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccacdd7b9d42212e3bfa0f2a590be6eaffbfd8f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,172,221,123,157,66,33,46,59,250,15,42,89,11,230,234,255,191,216,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
