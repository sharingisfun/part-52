I'm sorry that I couldn't get a more detailed info on this &quot;Daolang&quot;, the only two words in english on the CD is &quot;Daolang&quot; and &quot;2002&quot; - so I assume that the CD was made in 2002.\n\nWhen I asked about &quot;good rock music&quot; in a music store during my time in Beijing, one guy said that &quot;Daolang is good rock&quot;. And it is. It's actually closer to, for example, U2, so don't expect anything like Rammstein.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29fe0d005e553ee976445734a94c1d95da85189","amp;dn":"Daolang+-+2002+%28Chinese+Rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29fe0d005e553ee976445734a94c1d95da85189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,159,224,208,5,229,83,238,151,100,69,115,74,148,193,217,93,168,81,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
