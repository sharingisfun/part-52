The most cunning and skilled of these pilots is Porco Rosso, a man cursed with the head of a pig after watching the spirits of the pilots killed in the last air battle he fought in rise to the heavens. He now makes a living taking jobs, such as rescuing those kidnapped by air pirates. Donald Curtis, Porco&amp;#039;s rival in the air and in catching the affections of women, provides a constant challenge to the hero, culminating in a hilarious, action packed finale.\nSYSTEM: NTSC\nAUDIO: Spanish 2.0, English 2.0, Japanese 2.0\nSUBTITLES: Spanish, Enlgish, French, Japanese, Chinese\nRELATION ASPECT: 16:9\nCOMPRESSION: Rebuilder + CCE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c0dd80cc7739998f5935a3ba1905dc74015acaf","amp;dn":"Porco+Rosso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c0dd80cc7739998f5935a3ba1905dc74015acaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,13,216,12,199,115,153,152,245,147,90,59,161,144,93,199,64,21,172,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
