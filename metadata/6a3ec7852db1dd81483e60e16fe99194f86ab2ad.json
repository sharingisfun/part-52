to have\n                         the files defragmented through moving there :)\n    Download slots:      Maximum number of Downloads runing at once, suggestion\n                         is to set it to the same number as your upload slots\n   Sharing:\n    Upload slots:        The number of maximum simultaneous uploads, set to a reasonable\n                          value; you should have at least 4-5 KB/s uplaod speed per slot.\n   Appearance:\n    Use system icons:    Displays the icons set in Windows for filetypes\n    Language File:       A XML-file containing most of the text used in DC++.\n                          You can specify a file to have DC++ in your favourite language.\n                          There&amp;#039;s an example.xml if you want to make your own.\n                          Language files available at http://DCPlusPlus.sourceforge.net\n   Logs and Sound:\n    Log Downloads:       You can use this feature to see what downloads\n                          completed while you were AFK :)\n    Parameters for the logging (the things in %[xxx]):\n     target         target filename (for downloads)\n     source         source filename (for uploads)\n     user           nick\n     hub            hub name\n     hubip          hub ip\n     size           size of the file\n     sizeshort      size in b/kB/MB/GB (short version)\n     chunksize      size downloaded this session (if resuming, otherwise the same as size)\n     chunksizeshort ...\n     speed          speed of download\n     time           time to download (hh:mm:ss format)\n     sfv            1 if the file was sfv/crc32 checked, 0 otherwise\n   \n    You can also use all date and time parameters (%Y, %m, ...) of strftime (google for it).\n\n\n   Advanced:\n    Rollback:            Size of bytes to rollback when resuming a file to\n                          ensure it contains no errors.\n                         If there is an error DC++ deletes &lt;rollback&gt;\n                          bytes and checks again.\n    Write buffer size:   Anti-fragmentation feature, DC++ saves every\n                          &lt;write buffer size&gt; bytes to keep fragmentation low.\n    Client version:      Since most hubs specify a min client version that\n                          is much higher than DC++&amp;#039;s real version number you\n                          can set something here, i suggest adding 1 to version\n                          number e.g. 1.181\n                         to be able to enter the hub.\n    Automatically search for alternate download locations:  Allows DC++ to try\n                          to find other locations to download your files.\n                          Useful if you&amp;#039;re AFK a lot.\n    Install URL handler on startup:     Set if you want URLS of type dchub://\n                         to open in DC++\n    Use small send buffer:    If uploads slow down your downloads A LOT you may\n                         try this option, but beware it increases HD usage and\n                         slows down upload, so it&amp;#039;s not suggested.\n    Enable SFV checking: Many downloads on DC contain an sfv file to check the integrity of\n                         a download. DC++ can on-the-fly calculate CRC-32 values for\n                         a file and compare it agains the sfv file. If the check fails,\n                         the file is automatically downloaded once more from the same user\n                         and if that fails, the user is removed as a source. For this to work,\n                         the .sfv file must be in the same target directory as the download goes.\n\n 7 Other things you might want to know about\n----------------------------------------------\n  * you can doubleclick on a user name in chat to select him in the user list\n  * you can doubleclick on stuff starting with www. http:// of ftp:// to open :)\n  * DC++ supports uploading filelists and files &lt;16 kB to other DC++ users\n    WITHOUT REQUIRING A SLOT. There&amp;#039;s a max of 3 connections in addition to\n    normal slots.\n  * Files &lt;16 kB and filelists are downloaded first.\n  * There is information added to the description field:\n    &lt;++ V:x,M:x,H:x/y/z,S:x[,O:x]&gt; where\n     V = client version,\n     M = mode (a=active, p=passive),\n     H: x = number of hubs connected to where you&amp;#039;re not a registered user\n        y = number of hubs you&amp;#039;re registered in\n        z = number of hubs you&amp;#039;re registered as op\n     S = number of slots you have open.\n     O = if total upload is below this value DC++ will open another slot\n         this part of the tag is only shown when the option for it is enabled\n     This is updated every 1-2 minutes if there are changes.\n  * There is a limit so that only 15 users and 1 op can be kicked at a time\n    from the hub user list\n  * Passive user detection, those that are behind a set of bricks are passive.\n    (detected when the user searches or tries to connect to you)\n  * DC++ user detection, those appear blue.\n  * Dupe file removal, files with same name and size are automatically removed\n    from your share\n  * Search flood detection (If more than 5 searches are received from the same\n    user within 7 seconds, DC++ will send out a warning)\n  * if a user leaves the hub DC++ will close his slots, if the user is back within 10 minutes\n    DC++ will grant him a slot.\n    THIS CAN CAUSE YOUR UPLOAD GOING OVER MAXIMUM SET IN SETTINGS\n  * filelist will be recreated if missing on request\n  * optional SFV will remove and requeue file if check failed\n  * If DC++ receives &quot;banned&quot; during the login phase, it&amp;#039;ll stop automatically reconnecting\n  * Files containing &quot;$&quot; aren&amp;#039;t added to share &amp;#039;cause they won&amp;#039;t be downloadable alter on.\n    This is a protocol limitation ....\n\n\n 8 Shortcuts\n--------------\n  ALT-s   send chat message\n\n\n 9 Automatic search for alternative download locations\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAn automatic search (the advanced option &quot;Automatically search for \nalternative download locations&quot;) will use the search string defined in the \ndownload queue and it can be changed by the user. Previously (before \nv0.301) the search used the target filename. A good search string is the \nkey to find many sources. If the search string is empty there will be no \nsearch. The search string is also used when manually searching for alternates.\n\nYou can change the search string for many files at once, which is good for \nrar sets. However, a client will return at most 10 results on a search, 5 \nif you are passive, and trying to alter the search string for more than \nthose numbers will give you a warning.\n\nThe option in advanced settings below auto-search &quot;Automatically add search \nstring for alternative download locations&quot; will automatically set the \ntarget file name as search string when adding files to the download queue.\n\nSince v0.301 the auto search will also search for items in the download \nqueue which have online users. Previously only items with offline users \nwere searched and lead people to believe auto search was not working at \nall. This feature comes at a cost though. The delay between searches for \nitems with online users is 5 minutes whereas searches for items with no \nonline users is done every other minute. No search will be made for an item \nwhich has a source from whom you are already downloading a different file \nfrom. A file will be searched for no more than once per hour, so if you \nonly have one item in the download queue it will take one hour between \nsearches.\n\nWhat does &quot;Automatically search for alternative download locations&quot; do when \nno search strings are set? It will automatically match any search results \ncoming from manual searches against files in the download queue. So \nbasically it saves you the trouble of right-clicking every file you want to \nadd as an alternate source.\n\nExample search string for rar sets:\nFiles abc-cd1.r01 to abc-cd1.r09 can have the same search string set to \n&quot;abc-cd1.r0&quot; (passive users will only get 5 files returned so one search \nstring per file, like &quot;abc-cd1.r01&quot;). But don&amp;#039;t set it to &quot;abc .r0&quot; or \nsomething similar, this will give you rar files for CD2 as well. If you \ndon&amp;#039;t have sfv checking enabled (the advanced option &quot;Enable automatic SFV \nchecking&quot;) you can end up with the right files in the wrong place. This \nsearch for rar sets is so good that it&amp;#039;s even better (at least less time \nconsuming) than doing it yourself with manual searches and getting \nfilelists and use match queue. It gives you 10 files at once, even if there \nare online users.\n\nThat pretty much covers it.\n\nThanks Lundis for the first draft of this feature description and \nsuggesting and testing of the enhanced auto search in the first place.\n\n\n10 Further information\n------------------------\n  * Homepage                  @ http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net\n  * Forum                     @ http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/forum\n  * Report bugs               @ http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=427632&amp;group_id=40287&amp;func=browse\n  * Request features          @ http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=427635&amp;group_id=40287&amp;func=browse\n  * Download language files   @ http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=download\n  * Get newest version        @ http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=download\n  * Typos and errors in readme go to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4f09263d2a2d2e23230f2a21032628273b21262128612b2a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n11 Have fun\n-------------\n  Go out, share some files, be a happy DC++ user and have fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a3ec7852db1dd81483e60e16fe99194f86ab2ad","amp;dn":"DC%2B%2B_0.691","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a3ec7852db1dd81483e60e16fe99194f86ab2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,62,199,133,45,177,221,129,72,62,96,225,111,233,145,148,248,106,178,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
