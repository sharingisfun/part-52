Stick out your thumb to join the most ordinary man in the world on an extra-ordinary adventure across the universe in the hilarious comedy, THE HITCHHIKER&amp;#039;S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.  Earthman Arthur Dent (MARTIN FREEMAN) is having a very bad day.  His house is about to be bulldozed, he discovers that his best friend is an alien and to top things off, Planet Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass.  Arthur?s only chance for survival: hitch a ride on a passing spacecraft. For the novice space traveler, the greatest adventure in the universe begins when the world ends. Arthur sets out on a journey in which he finds that nothing is as it seems: he learns that a towel is just the most useful thing in the universe, finds the meaning of life, and discovers that everything he needs to know can be found in one book:  The Hitchhiker?s Guide to the Galaxy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3aa9c17fb90fc6fbd097f3fa9e8f6093961d73c","amp;dn":"Guia+del+autoestopista+galactico","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3aa9c17fb90fc6fbd097f3fa9e8f6093961d73c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,170,156,23,251,144,252,111,189,9,127,63,169,232,246,9,57,97,215,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
