They are no less than amazing! On their later albums the band also incorporates jazz elements into their music (I&amp;#039;d say that there&amp;#039;s more jazz than metal on their last release!). Unfortunately, this wonderful band called it quits some years ago... \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPHANTASMAGORY\nOdd Sounds\nÃ‚Â© 1999 Phantasmagory\nÃ‚Â© 2000 The Flaming Arts Productions\nÃ‚Â© 2005 Magik Art Entertainment\n\n1.

I would say, musically it&amp;#039;s far matured and sophisticated as their debut album &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;. &quot;Odd Sounds&quot; opens new dimensions for both progressive and atmospheric kind of Death Metal. It contains 7 extremely well executed songs, which are all excellent in my opinion. Believe me, there&amp;#039;s no vacancy in their songs. Everything is done with minds and what&amp;#039;s more thoroughly. I love every inch of their music; especially the skilful inclusions of sci-fi based keyboard effects. Also, I should take a mention about the remarkable sound production and thoughtful lyrics. No doubt, PHANTASMAGORY deserves to be known worldwide, because they know how to create flawless songs! (Cornelius, ENCOMIUM Webzine #3)\n\nUkraine&amp;#039;s PHANTASMAGORY are an impressive progressive death metal band. Tight, well-structured songs make up this seven-song release, a definite ear-pleaser to fans of technical death metal in the vein of PESTILENCE and CYNIC. There are a lot of bands out there who make an effort to really shine and showcase their talent and PHANTASMAGORY are one of those bands. Production here, especially for a demo, is top notch and the band really captured their best work. One thing that really impressed me about this demo from PHANTASMAGORY is the variety that the seven-song demo offers: everything from technical death metal to thrash metal heaviness, heavy metal guitar solos and black metal-inspired screams. This demo is all over the place, but not in a bad way. Like the album title suggests, &quot;odd sounds&quot; indeed. I have heard a lot about this band over the years, having read numerous articles about them, and it&amp;#039;s nice to finally put music to what I know about them. Easily the gem of my New Noise pile this issue. 4/5 (Adrian Bromley, CHRONICLES OF CHAOS e-Zine #55)\n\nI confess, first I even told ÃƒÂ¢??noÃƒÂ¢?? when he was going to send me this piece. Techno-death metal in the vein of CYNIC and ATHEIST, what one can expect from such a predictable failureÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦? Especially if the band delivering this kind of music comes from Ukraine! Well, narrow-mindedness never gets things go better, now I know that. When I got the tape anyway, I, frankly speaking, couldnÃƒÂ¢??t leave my room for hours, playing it again and again, again and again. Similar to CYNIC and ATHEIST? What a bullshit! PHANTASMAGORY deliver atmospheric mid-paced death metal soaked with synth-lines all the way through, performed with unbelievable skillfulness, moreover ÃƒÂ¢?? imaginatively conceived. This must be the best effort in the shape of demo IÃƒÂ¢??m reviewing this issue, and too bad that these chaps donÃƒÂ¢??t even have enough money to send out promo stuff (sounds surprising, since the way ÃƒÂ¢??Odd SoundsÃƒÂ¢?? had been executed undoubtedly doesnÃƒÂ¢??t deserve to be criticized). Listen to me carefully and follow my advise: ÃƒÂ¢??Odd SoundsÃƒÂ¢?? is a must to have piece for everyone into metalÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ or any other sort of music. 6/6 (Herr Stalhammar, VAE SOLIS Webzine)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5374ea48c0d528e8547432d748956ef90b9b977","amp;dn":"PHANTASMAGORY+-+Odd+Sounds+%40+FLAC+psychedelic+technodeath+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5374ea48c0d528e8547432d748956ef90b9b977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,55,78,164,140,13,82,142,133,71,67,45,116,137,86,239,144,185,185,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
