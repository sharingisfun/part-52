Interspersed throughout the concert footage are behind-the-scenes moments with the band.\n\nThe members of Led Zeppelin are called back from vacation by manager Peter Grant to play Madison Square Garden. The film is enhanced by each of the band member&amp;#039;s personal fantasies (hallucinations?), such as the opening scene (which is awfully confusing the first time around) in which Peter Grant, dressed in a 1930s black gangster suit drives a 1930s black Ford to a house and blasts everyone with a machine gun.\n\nDVD Features:\n\nKeep Case\nTheatrical Trailer\nAnamorphic Widescreen\n\nSpecial Features:\nInteractive Menus\nScene Access\nEnglish and French Subtitles\n\n\nDirector Peter Clifton, Joe Massot\nStar Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Bonham, John Paul Jones\nSpecial Effects Ian Knight, Shelly, Kirby Wyatt\nDirector of Photography Ernest Day, Phil Parmet\nEditor Peter Clifton\nMusic Led Zeppelin\nSound Engineer \tEddie Kramer\nSound Mixer Jimmy Page\n\n\nDVD scene listing\n   1.
