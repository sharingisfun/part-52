All of them function primarily to set or clear a specific registry key that is used to detect and block download of Service Packs from Windows Update. You only need to use the component which best serves your organizationÃƒÂ¢??s computer management infrastructure. \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· A Microsoft-signed executable \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· A script \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· An ADM template \n\nNOTE: This toolkit will not prevent the installation of the service pack from CD/DVD, or from the stand-alone download package. This simply prevents the service pack from being delivered over Windows Update.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba98ca86bb76a2242b7ef8e7910b173bd443abd5","amp;dn":"Windows+Service+Pack+Blocker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba98ca86bb76a2242b7ef8e7910b173bd443abd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,152,202,134,187,118,162,36,43,126,248,231,145,11,23,59,212,67,171,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
