A pivotal artistic canon is that of French Impressionism. By considering the artists, the museums showcasing Impressionist artwork, the collectors who donated it to museums, and the scholars and art professionals who have written about the art, this work explores the evolution of this canon and its now iconic role in Western culture. The book also highlights the role of the public in supporting and solidifying the structure of the French Impressionist canon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36038293b57a7a9e244f9be6e17eb1b726680c2c","amp;dn":"Impressionism+and+its+canon.+James+Cutting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36038293b57a7a9e244f9be6e17eb1b726680c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,3,130,147,181,122,122,158,36,79,155,230,225,126,177,183,38,104,12,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
