Other members included vocalist (and former milkman) Max Bacon (ex-Moby Dick, Nightwing, Bronz), bassist Phil Spalding (ex-Bernie Torme, Toyah, Mike Oldfield, Original Mirrors), and American drummer Jonathan Mover (ex-Marillion, later of Steve Vai fame). GTR were notable for attempting to create a band with guitar and synthesizer sounds, but without the use of conventional keyboard synths, using guitar-based synthesizers instead. Hackett and Howe&amp;#039;s guitars were outfitted with Roland synthesizer trigger pickups, which used the vibrations of the strings to create MIDI signals used to play the synthesizers. While this may have worked in the studio, they were forced to take a keyboardist on the road because of the poor tracking qualities of the guitar synths.\n\nGTR&amp;#039;s only studio album, a self-titled LP produced by Geoffrey Downes of Asia, released by Arista Records, went gold and spawned a hit single, &quot;When the Heart Rules the Mind&quot;, \n\n\n1.WHEN THE HEART RULES THE MIND  \n2.THE HUNTER    \n3.HERE I WAIT   \n4.SKETCHES IN THE SUN  \n5.JEKYLL AND HYDE   \n6.YOU CAN STILL GET THROUGH   \n7.REACH OUT (NEVER SAY NO)    \n8.TOE THE LINE   \n9.HACKETT TO BITS   \n10.IMAGINING    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0453f4942041479eb5e065b34360aae13bbbdc2c","amp;dn":"GTR-GTR-320-Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0453f4942041479eb5e065b34360aae13bbbdc2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,83,244,148,32,65,71,158,181,224,101,179,67,96,170,225,59,187,220,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
