Nicolas Cage is Seth, an angel who must decide if he&amp;#039;ll forsake his immortality and become human--on the chance that the woman of his dreams might love him. That woman is Maggie (Meg Ryan), a pragmatic heart surgeon who doesn&amp;#039;t believe in angels...until she meets Seth. Will love be their mutual destiny? Will they take the risks that shape that destiny? The choice is theirs to make.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d062bd1aff9c1fa14f594c2d7a9b04a7321858c2","amp;dn":"City+of+Angels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d062bd1aff9c1fa14f594c2d7a9b04a7321858c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,98,189,26,255,156,31,161,79,89,76,45,122,155,4,167,50,24,88,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
