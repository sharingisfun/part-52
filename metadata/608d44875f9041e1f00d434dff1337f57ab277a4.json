Wondering\n2. Only To Sleep In\n3. Two Piece Feat. Michi\n4. Wondering (Praveen&amp;#039;s &quot;Everything Is Going\nTo Be Alright&quot; Remix)\n5. Only To Sleep In (Tonetraeger Remix)\n6. Sequence Four\n\nWhat a long and sad road these songs have traveled.\nThey are parts from what was a full lenght record. it moved from a couple different labels. Eventually to land no where. So we made this Ep out of my favorite parts. the whole album (without the remix&amp;#039;s) can be found on soulseek. To think this is the sound of Pandatone betweem &quot;Lemons &amp; Limes&quot; &amp; Happy Together&quot; is almost odd. &quot;Wondering&quot; in various forms made it&amp;#039;s way from texas to Tokyo on various compilations. here Praveen Sharma gives us possibly the best version yet. Tonetraeger (Hauschka &amp; TG Mauss) applies their leftfield pop sense to &quot;Only to Sleep In&quot;, making it a more minimal and disjointed pop effort. And Two Piece gives us a lovely guest appernce by MacDonald Duck Eclairs &quot;Micihi&quot;. The Video below was created by Ilan Katin, and was going to also be on the original album. lot&amp;#039;s of people put a lot of work into this now free release. please enjoy it.\ndonations are of course apperciated.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:608d44875f9041e1f00d434dff1337f57ab277a4","amp;dn":"CTR-AI_pandatone_what_has_nature_done_for_me_recently_ep_2007_cr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"608d44875f9041e1f00d434dff1337f57ab277a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,141,68,135,95,144,65,225,240,13,67,77,255,19,55,245,122,178,119,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
