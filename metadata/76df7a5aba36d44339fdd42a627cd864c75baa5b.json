I only seed in fully encrypted mode, so you must use clients that support encryption.\t\n\n\ntorrent info:\t\n\nI merged two of the best torrentz about this movie. they weren&amp;#039;t exactly easy to find, and together they have all the materials a serious release should have.\n\nall the credit goes to the wonderful pirates who ripped and seeded the material in the original torrents. i&amp;#039;ve simply pasted them together.\n\nthe large nrg file in this torrent is identical to the one in another of my torrents. i left that one stuck at about 31%, but anyone can replace it in this torrent&amp;#039;s folder, and resume with no loss.\n\nBitcomet is recommended for resuming the nrg file, and for better compatibility, as it is the client i&amp;#039;m seeding with.\n\npiece size is 8 MB, in an effort to minimize overhead, in terms of bandwidth and tracker resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76df7a5aba36d44339fdd42a627cd864c75baa5b","amp;dn":"Silent+running+%28+Douglas+Trumbull+1972+%29+%2B+commentary+%2B+intervie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76df7a5aba36d44339fdd42a627cd864c75baa5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,223,122,90,186,54,212,67,57,253,212,42,98,124,216,100,199,91,170,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
