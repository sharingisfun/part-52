MSP has two terminals, the older Lindbergh terminal with its seven concourses, and the newer Humphrey terminal.  The two terminals have been modeled with the highest level of detail allowed by the Flight Simulator.  Special attention was paid to the accuracy of the airport layout, including runways, taxiways and ramps as well as the configuration and location of all airline gates.  The FAA control tower, fire stations, general aviation, aircraft maintenance, cargo and military facilities have been depicted.  The highest degree of detail was also applied to all major buildings in those areas. As a bonus, a model of the Mall of America (the US largest) is included to increase realism during approach to runway 35.\n\nScenery Features:\n\nCustom-made, optimized Gmax models of most buildings within the airport grounds including the two passenger terminals and a total of eight concourses, the control tower and fire stations,  the Northwest and Sun Country Airlines maintenance complexes, and all general aviation and cargo facilities. Some of the USAF and Minnesota Air National Guard hangars and buildings have also been modeled. \n\nCustom-made, optimized textures for all Gmax generated buildings.  In the FSX version, reflective effects were used in the textures of all major buildings. \n\nCustom-made, high-resolution photo real ground textures in and around the airport depicting seasonal changes and improved blending with the surrounding ground textures* \n\nAccurate runway and taxiway layouts, including detailed markings and signals \n\nCustom-made AI mapping file including realistic gate and parking spot assignments** \n\nThree levels of scenery complexity, from &quot;Normal&quot; to &quot;Very High&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f316457de5577299bd73d8a9105013229b2f418","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+BluePrint+Simulations+-+KMSP+v1.1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f316457de5577299bd73d8a9105013229b2f418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,49,100,87,222,85,119,41,155,215,61,138,145,5,1,50,41,178,244,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
