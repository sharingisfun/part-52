Young pilot Cliff Secord stumbles on a top secret rocket-pack and with the help of his mechanic/mentor, Peevee, he attempts to save his girl and stop the Nazis as The Rocketeer.

Myself and a score of others had been trying to download this for a very long time using DHT but after the seeders left we got stuck at exactly 99.0% for several weeks.  So I rented the movie, ripped it to the computer, and seeded the 1% back into the swarm.  Now there are 17 seeders -GET IT WHILE IT&amp;#039;S &quot;HOT&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c4f1fc43c0a600294cbd66e2882545903348bdf","amp;dn":"The+Rocketeer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c4f1fc43c0a600294cbd66e2882545903348bdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,79,31,196,60,10,96,2,148,203,214,110,40,130,84,89,3,52,139,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
