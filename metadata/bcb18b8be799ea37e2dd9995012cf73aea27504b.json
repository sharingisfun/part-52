This is his first album, and its a pretty good one.\n\nYou can tell he likes lots of different music - this album makes me think of Jeff Buckley, Dylan, Radiohead, John Butler Trio, Led Zeppelin, Tori Amos, Mike Paton and Joni Mitchell. This is a gutsy nu-folk/experimental/alternative/blues album with an edge.\n\nThis guy is not very well known, and this is clearly a low-budget recording, but that just adds to the charm. A nice mix of songs.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb18b8be799ea37e2dd9995012cf73aea27504b","amp;dn":"Angus+Wallace+-+Yesterdays+Conversation+%5B2008%5D+nu-folk%2Fexperimen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb18b8be799ea37e2dd9995012cf73aea27504b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,177,139,139,231,153,234,55,226,221,153,149,1,44,247,58,234,39,80,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
