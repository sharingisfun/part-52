and &amp;#039;Anti-Hacker Firewall&amp;#039;\n       in that package, the rest is not really needed in my opinion and are\n       only pulling resources.\n       \n       You can find it here:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;

Reduced memory usage idle at desktop from 38% to 17% (2GB Corsair Dominator DDR2 1066). Jumped my FPS in Crysis it seemed about 7-15FPS to an almost playabe average of 28FPS with all settings HIGH (8800 GTS 512MB, 1680x1050)\n\n\nOh!
