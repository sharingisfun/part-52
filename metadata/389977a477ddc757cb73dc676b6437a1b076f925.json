The Sea Star crew, their ship slowly sinking, has sought refuge in the eerie calm of the eye of a typhoon to make repairs and hopefully avert disaster. But something&amp;#039;s terribly wrong. The ship, a Russian science vessel bristling with high-tech radar, electronics and other wonders, appears to be deserted. Unfortunately for the crew of the Sea Star, nothing could be further from the truth. Shelter from the storm turns into terror on board as they find themselves stalked by a mutating alien life form that has traveled across time and space, an energy force unlike any in the universe. It is powerful. Intelligent. And it has found the perfect planet to inhabit. Now, in order to survive, it must destroy the one threat to its existence: a virus called man\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389977a477ddc757cb73dc676b6437a1b076f925","amp;dn":"VIRUS+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389977a477ddc757cb73dc676b6437a1b076f925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,153,119,164,119,221,199,87,203,115,220,103,107,100,55,161,176,118,249,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
