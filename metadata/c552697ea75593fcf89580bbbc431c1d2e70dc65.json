So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.\nI like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. \nTill now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more \nhave managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.\nRemember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.\nThe date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. \nThe creation may take from just one day to many months.\n\nA few words about MIXAMIX 20071008\n\nDear music and trip lovers. \nThis time I am proud to give you a real road mix. It&amp;#039;s been a month since I started it but I believe it really worths it.\nI &amp;#039;ve done many alpha and betas versions road tests to come up with this final. I have worked every single transition for hours \nand I have come to create many of my own unique mixes reviving some old tracks.\nHear for example Apoptygma Berzerk - Mourn (Mesh Remix) combined with Insomnia tune and wonder why was is not like this from the beginning.\nBronski Beat - Smalltown Boy is lived up with new fresh beat.Knack - My Sharona too. \nTry to detect what is the quitar sample I used under VnV Nation&amp;#039;s - Beloved. \nAlso as you can see from the selection this mix has a great deal of rock sound and with this I hope I satisfy some of the \nfriends that contacted me and asked for more this. Of course being loyal to my music style I have a little bit of everything as always!\nCome by my site rate my mixes and leave a comment if you want. Hope you will enjoy this as much as I do. \n\n\tKeep travelling, sharing music and have fun!\n\t\n  \n21 tracks in playlist, average track length: 3:33\nPlaylist length: 1 hour 14 minutes 50 seconds\n\n    Playlist files:\n\n          1.
