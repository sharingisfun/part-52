Rating:  \t\n  3.8 / 5 (based on 3 ratings).\n\nPlot:\tThis soulful, powerful, intelligent, and beautifully-made martial arts epic about a master swordsman protecting a treasure chest on a dangerous journey stands beside &quot;The Deadly Breaking Sword&quot; and &quot;The Kung Fu Instructor&quot; as one of the director&amp;#039;s best.\n\nOverview:\tSun Chung had been recognized as an expert comedy and crime thriller director, but he was to gain even greater acclaim for his soulful, powerful, intelligent, and beautifully-made martial arts epics. This stands alongside &quot;The Deadly Breaking Sword&quot; and &quot;The Kung Fu Instructor&quot; as one of his very best. It&amp;#039;s not so much the plot--a master swordsman protects a treasure chest on a dangerous journey--that makes this great, but what Sun does with it, inspiring the cast and crew to some of their finest work.\n\nCourtesy Of HKFlix Site.\n\nCast: \tChen Kuan-Tai  ||  Ku Feng  ||  Lo Lieh  ||  Wong Yu  ||  Yuen Wah  ||  Chan Shen  ||  Sek Gong  ||  Chow Kin-Ping  ||  Chan Si-Gaai  ||  Teresa Ha Ping  ||  Jamie Luk Kim-Ming  ||  Johnny Wang Lung-Wei  ||  Lam Sau-Kwan  ||  Lau Wai-Ling  ||  Shum Lo  ||  Tang Ching  ||  Wong Mei-Mei  ||  Yuen Bun  ||  Dang Wai-Ho  ||  Jeng Kei-Ying  ||  Gam Gwan  ||  Ringo Wong  ||  Yeung Hung \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
