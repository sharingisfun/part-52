With this album the band turned towards a more tranquil, sedate, slower sound with beats. The dark mood of this album reflects the strife within the band during this era, when member Sen Dog temporarily left the band to pursue other projects.\n\nThe album was certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\nWu-Tang Clan members RZA and U-God both make appearances on &quot;Killa Hill Niggas&quot;. Also notable was track &quot;No Rest For The Wicked&quot; which ignited the feud between Cypress Hill and rapper Ice Cube&amp;#039;s band Westside Connection, who they claimed, stole material from the band. On many shows of the &quot;Temples Of Boom&quot; tour, the group would take time in between songs to talk about this feud and get the crowd to yell obscenities about Ice-Cube. This track was answered by Ice-Cube&amp;#039;s Westside Connection group&amp;#039;s album, which featured track &quot;King Of The Hill&quot;.\n\n   1. &quot;Spark Another Owl&quot; (Freese, Muggs) ? 3:40\n   2. &quot;Throw Your Set in the Air&quot; (Freese, Muggs) ? 4:08\n   3. &quot;Stoned Raiders&quot; (Freese, Muggs, Reyes) ? 2:54\n   4. &quot;Illusions&quot; (Freese, Muggs) ? 4:29\n   5. &quot;Killa Hill Niggas&quot; (ft.
