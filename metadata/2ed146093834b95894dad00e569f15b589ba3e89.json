Multicore support\n\nGRAW2 makes full use of the available cores: when a game instance is started, \nit determines its main core, and will use the remaining ones for other systems \n(rendering and physics for instance). Therefore, you would get much better \nperformances if you do *not* set the core affinity for the game executables. \nSeveral dedicated servers are also supported: the first instance will automatically \nuse core 1 as its main core, the second instance core 2, etc.\n\n2. Running multiple dedicated servers\n\nPatch 1.03 adds new command line parameters to properly support multiple \ndedicated servers on a single machine: \n-dedicated_game_info : allows you to use a specific game info file (that can be created ingame),\nin which you can change the port number used by the game by adding \n(replace xxxxx by the new port number) inside the node.\n\n-port : this will override the default port, and the one defined in the game info file.\n\nYou can also make use of multiple network cards:\n-network_list: prints the list of available network interfaces.\n-network_ip : selects the network interface by local ip address\n-network_index : selects the network interface by index. Network interfaces are \n-enumerated from 0 and upwards.\n\n\n\nSpecial Info Note:\n\nSome virus-scanner recognize the header of packed exe&amp;#039;s (ToeD.exe)\n\nas a lame virus, (coz it&amp;#039;s the mostly byte by byte check error of &amp;#039;em!.)\n\nThis is truly a false information!,  a so called false positive, you can read \n\nmore about in your VirusTool-Manual or WebSite!.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReleased 1st by no one else than ....&gt; ToeD! &lt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ed146093834b95894dad00e569f15b589ba3e89","amp;dn":"PC_GRAW2.Update+V1.3+-ToeD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ed146093834b95894dad00e569f15b589ba3e89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,209,70,9,56,52,185,88,148,218,208,14,86,159,21,181,137,186,62,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
