Why are people turning against their neighbors and their newborn children? And what is causing an epidemic of still births? A disgraced paleontologist and a genetic engineer both come across evidence of cover-ups in which the government is clearly up to no good. But no one knows what&amp;#039;s really going on, and the government is covering up because that is what, in thrillers as in life, governments do. And what has any of this to do with the discovery of a Neanderthal family whose mummified faces show signs of a strange peeling?\nGreg Bear has spent much of his recent career evoking awe in the deep reaches of space, but he made his name with Blood Music, a novel of nanotechnology that crackled with intelligence. His new book is a workout for the mind and a stunning read; human malignancy has its role in his thriller plot, but its real villain, as well as its last best hope, is the endless ingenious cruelty of the natural world and evolution.\n\naudio\naudiobook\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4efe0b7a0adcd8af766c6009209b5c8eb8c6af0","amp;dn":"%5BAudiobook%5D+Greg+Bear+-+Darwins+Radio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4efe0b7a0adcd8af766c6009209b5c8eb8c6af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,239,224,183,160,173,205,138,247,102,198,0,146,9,181,200,235,140,106,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
