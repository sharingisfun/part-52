A duo comprised of James Kirby and Andy McGregor (aka Jansky Noise), V/Vm produced a series of releases notorious for their crude (but lovingly detailed) packaging, high collectability (usually only 100 to 500 copies), and, in many cases the music itself, a devastating assault on both copyright laws and hearing levels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0149717fcb724c32added23b69428438a6ef085a","amp;dn":"VVM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0149717fcb724c32added23b69428438a6ef085a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,73,113,127,203,114,76,50,173,222,210,59,105,66,132,56,166,239,8,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
