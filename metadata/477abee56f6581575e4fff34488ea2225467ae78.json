He has been hit by a Bosnian Serb missile. The fighter pilot ejects from his disintegrating plane and parachutes to earth, landing deep in hostile territory. With armed militia hot on his heels, O'Grady dives into the undergrowth. Moments later his pursuers pass five feet from his head. For six days, O'Grady evades capture, moving only by night, desperately trying to establish radio contact with his comrades. On the sixth night, a pilot from O'Grady's air base finally hears his radio call, setting into motion a daring, daylight rescue mission by U.S. Marines.\n\n\nVisit http://prince213.blogspot.com/ for more...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:477abee56f6581575e4fff34488ea2225467ae78","amp;dn":"Downed+Pilot+H264+TVRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"477abee56f6581575e4fff34488ea2225467ae78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,122,190,229,111,101,129,87,94,79,255,52,72,142,162,34,84,103,174,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
