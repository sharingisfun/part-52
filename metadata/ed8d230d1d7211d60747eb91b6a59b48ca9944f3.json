Kitson\nCategories Instructional, Essays, Psychology\nLanguage English\nNotes\n\nEducational leaders are seeing with increasing clearness the necessity of teaching students not only the subject-matter of study but also methods of study. The recognition of this condition is taking the form of the movement toward &amp;#039;&amp;#039;supervised study,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; which attempts to acquaint the student with principles of economy and directness in using his mind. It is generally agreed that there are certain &amp;#039;&amp;#039;tricks&amp;#039;&amp;#039; which make for mental efficiency, consisting of methods of apperceiving facts, methods of review, devices for arranging work. Some are the fruits of psychological experimentation; others are derived from experience. Many of them can be imparted by instruction, and it is for the purpose of systematizing these and making them available for students that this book is prepared.\n\nApprox. 40,460 words.\n\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed8d230d1d7211d60747eb91b6a59b48ca9944f3","amp;dn":"How+to+Use+Your+Mind+eBooK+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed8d230d1d7211d60747eb91b6a59b48ca9944f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,141,35,13,29,114,17,214,7,71,235,145,182,165,155,72,202,153,68,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
