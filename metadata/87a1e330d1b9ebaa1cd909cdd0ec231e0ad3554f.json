One day she is confronted by Lenin and her girlfriend Mao who immediately is attracted to Marcia and asks her if she wants to have sex. Frightened but intrigued, Marcia sets out on a road trip with Mao and Lenin.\n\nThis upload of the Argentinian movie Suddenly (Tan de repente) contains optional English subtitles I incorporated to the film. The subs will most probably show on any DivX-certified dvd hardware player (usually there is a DivX logo on the dvd front panel). To activate the English or Swedish subs, press the Subtitle button on your dvd remote.\n\nAlso included: separate subtitle files if you want to watch the film on your computer.\n\nFor Swedes: Svensk undertext gÃƒÂ¥r att spela upp i vanliga dvd-spelare som ÃƒÂ¤r DivX-certifierade. NÃƒÂ¤r du har startat filmen, tryck pÃƒÂ¥ Subtitle pÃƒÂ¥ fjÃƒÂ¤rrkontrollen fÃƒÂ¶r att aktivera engelska eller svenska undertexter. Du kan ocksÃƒÂ¥ ladda filmen i datorn och koppla den separata undertextfilen till din videouppspelare.\n\n\nBlack &amp; White\n\nSpoken language: Spanish\n\n20 awards and 6 nominations (according to IMDB)\n\n\n\nRatings:\n\n*IMDB rating ca. 6.5/10\n\n*Uppiggande argentinsk filmdebut (SvD 4/5)\n\n*Mycket uppfriskande (GP 4/5)\n\n* (1/5) Nothing sudden in suddenly \nBy A. Customer (Amazon.com)\nThe cover promises to be outrageous, funny and hip, but I failed to see any of those throughout the whole film. The subtitles might keep you from falling asleep, but do not add anything to the film. It seems to meander through ill-conceived plots that have no over-riding momentum. Most of the time watching the film was spent trying to work out why I was watching the film. I would advise that your money is better spent on something with a plot.\n\n\nWith thanks to The Pirate Bay.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a1e330d1b9ebaa1cd909cdd0ec231e0ad3554f","amp;dn":"%28Lesbian+%2F+roadmovie%29+Suddenly+%28DivX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a1e330d1b9ebaa1cd909cdd0ec231e0ad3554f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,161,227,48,209,185,235,170,28,217,9,205,208,236,35,30,10,211,85,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
