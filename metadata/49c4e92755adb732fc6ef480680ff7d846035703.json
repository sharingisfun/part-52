Somehow I missed a segment in the beginning that is actually the last 30 seconds or so of the Arizona State/Arizona game.  Please accept my apology for this oversight. I thought about editing and re-encoding it but it was going to take too long and I wanted to get the game released.  This file is 2.5 gig and is 29.97 FPS.  Oh, my receiver also decided to turn itself off with the game clock at 3 seconds.  Technical difficulties all over the place on this one.  Hope everyone interested enjoys!!!
