Soon after the battle, Lou makes a terrible mistake which he sets out to undo. With the help of G. Zeus, he searches for an artifact with a mysterious power to undo things that have been done. And the story gets weirder from there, taking Lou to all the way to Egypt, into space, and on.\n\nThis game features traditional turn-based RPG battles and some interesting spells and summons, along with funny spoken dialogue. However, the gameplay is somewhat shallow and is really little more than a reason to call this a game. Fortunately, the real pleasure is playing is to see how the utterly bizzare story unfolds, and, with the help of some rather hilarious dialogue, can be a suprising pleasure.\n\nThe soundtrack is also one of this games really strong points. Every situation and level has been perfectly matched with atmospheric and emotional music, and at many times is suprisingly fitting with the humorous nature of the game. Additionally, almost all of the dialogue is the game is spoken by some very talented voice actors, adding to the immersion. Unfortnately, the graphics don't exactly hold up to these standards, mostly consisting of cheap, low-poly models and often messy textures. Though there are sometime quite beautiful hand-drawn levels, there are few and they don't match the rest of the 3D levels.\n\nOverall, this game is worth a playthrough, either if you're a really hardcore RPGer or you're just really curious. I will warn you, unless you get pretty far into the game, the story will not be so gripping, so it is likely that you may not even make is past the second &quot;level&quot; out of boredom. However, if you play through the whole game, you will find yourself quite satisfied.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6047e713c97f2cc54c628423bdbc6e5e43837bae","amp;dn":"Crazy+Cross","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6047e713c97f2cc54c628423bdbc6e5e43837bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,71,231,19,201,127,44,197,76,98,132,35,189,188,110,94,67,131,123,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
