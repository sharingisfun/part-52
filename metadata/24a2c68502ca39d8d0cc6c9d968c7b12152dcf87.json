This group of cynical, insecure, strange, angry, and shy loners is forced to examine their problems under the scrutiny of their peers. However, being led by an inexperienced graduate of psychology and self-proclaimed healer, the group becomes more exasperated than healed. In pursuit of acceptance, the group is willing to try anything to move beyond their debilitating disorders, but are they being pushed too far? In the end, will coming to this group cause more harm than good?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442693&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442693&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------\n| Notes        |\n----------------\n\nMajor Productions was created by Marcus Major Niehaus in 2003 to produce the independent film Open Up!.
