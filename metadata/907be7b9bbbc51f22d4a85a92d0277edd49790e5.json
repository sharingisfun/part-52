They began the band with the idea of starting &quot;The World&amp;#039;s Worst Band&quot;. The name (made up by beloved band friend Mark Potter) was chosen because lime-flavored Jell-O was widely regarded as the worst Jell-O flavor, and Bill thought the name reflected their band&amp;#039;s talents. Barely able to play instruments, the band began playing punk shows around Buffalo, New York, with the intention of acting crazy onstage. The band was so technically inept that Joe (then playing bass) had to color-code his bass so that songs could be learned by color, such as &quot;red, green, blue, blue, green&quot;, etc.\n\nIn 1991, the band approached BMG subsidiary label Zoo Entertainment, and stating they were the &quot;World&amp;#039;s First Video Only Band,&quot; claimed they could make the entire project (all music, videos, artwork, etc) entirely on their own for the unheard of sum of $50,000. Zoo signed them on the spot...only problem was, it had been a bluff, and the band had never made a &quot;video album&quot; before. After buying a video camera, some wood, and some lights, the band set out to learn on the job, and in the fall of 1992 delivered their 3rd album, the longform video only Cereal Killer. Consisting of music videos for each song, as well as a behind-the-scenes feature, the video album slowly gained a reputation in underground (although it would eventually go on to sell in excess of 100,000 copies). Their break came when a radio station in Seattle, WA, KXRX, played &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; as a joke, but instead the phones lit up and it became a local hit. This caused Zoo Ent. to issue the EP Green JellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ SUXX, consisting of four songs from Cereal Killer, which in turn lead to the &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; becoming the #1 song in the history of &quot;The Box&quot; (a pay-per-play tv jukebox network). By the beginning of 1993, the song was gaining airplay around the country, and after appearing on MTV Headbanger&amp;#039;s Ball everything exploded. MTV added the video and the full-length audio album Cereal Killer Soundtrack was finally released in April 1993.\n\nThe video for &quot;Three Little Pigs,&quot; was directed by Fred Stuhr (who also directed Tool&amp;#039;s &quot;Sober&quot; video), and it featured a claymation rendition of the classic fairy tale with modern twists, such as pot-smoking pigs, an appearance by Rambo, and a Harley Davidson-riding wolf. The video was an instant hit on MTV and was #1 for most of the summer of 1993 in the US, receiving both a MTV music award and Billboard music award nomination. Meanwhile in the UK the song entered the singles chart at number 5 (the highest rock debut in the history of the British charts at the time), though this proved to be its peak position. As a result of the &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; video, the Cereal Killer Soundtrack album went gold in the US, New Zealand, and Canada, as well as platinum in Australia, eventually selling over 2Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ million units worldwide.\n\nTrack Listing\n1.&quot;Obey the Cowgod&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:10 \n2.&quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:54 \n3.&quot;Cereal Killer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:30 \n4.&quot;Rock-N-Roll Pumpkihn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:43 \n5.&quot;Anarchy in Bedrock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:29 \n6.&quot;Electric Harley House (Of Love)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:37 \n7.&quot;Trippin&amp;#039; on XTC&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:42 \n8.&quot;Misadventures of Shitman&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:08 \n9.&quot;House Me Teenage Rave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:30 \n10.&quot;Flight of the Skajaquada&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:00 \n11.&quot;Green JellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿ Theme Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:15 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907be7b9bbbc51f22d4a85a92d0277edd49790e5","amp;dn":"Green+Jell%C3%83%C2%B6+-+Cereal+Killer+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907be7b9bbbc51f22d4a85a92d0277edd49790e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,123,231,185,187,188,81,242,45,74,133,169,45,2,119,237,212,151,144,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
