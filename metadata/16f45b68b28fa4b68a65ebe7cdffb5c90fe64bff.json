A father and son, the dad played a type of bagpipe, it sounded amazing - very cool note intervals. Son played drums, and was pretty good - esp considering he only looked about 10 yo.\n\nThey put on a really good show. This is a bootleg, and is reasonable quality (not from the desk or anything tho) - there is some crowd noise, but the crowd is generally quiet during the music.\n\nLater on in the festival, there was a huge jam session, and the bagpipe dude absolutely went off - so cool. The crowd loved him. Didn&amp;#039;t get a recording of that, unfortunately.\n\nI don&amp;#039;t think they have a website, and I don&amp;#039;t know much about them - haven&amp;#039;t found any of their albums either. Check them out if you get the chance - they put on a great show!\n\nI&amp;#039;ve also put a couple of photos from the gig into the torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16f45b68b28fa4b68a65ebe7cdffb5c90fe64bff","amp;dn":"Ensemble+Shanbehzadeh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16f45b68b28fa4b68a65ebe7cdffb5c90fe64bff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,244,91,104,178,143,164,182,138,101,235,231,205,255,181,201,15,230,75,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
