Individual comics that comprise the TPB, according to DC Comic&amp;#039;s website, were also included, for whoever preferred that method.\n\n&quot;A massive trade paperback collecting the tale of Metropolis&amp;#039; most powerful man making his way to the White House! The stories, reprinted from ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN #581, PRESIDENT LUTHOR SECRET FILES, SUPERMAN: LEX 2000, SUPERMAN #162-165, SUPERMAN: MAN OF STEEL #108-110, and ACTION COMICS #773, also include guest appearances by Aquaman, Tempest, Batman and the JLA!&quot;\n\nNot sure on the reading order.
