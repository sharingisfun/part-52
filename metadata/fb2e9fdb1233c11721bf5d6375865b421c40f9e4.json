The three operational modes are: \n\nNormal mode: Provides unobtrusive protection for everyday use without requiring an understanding of firewall technology or complex configuration. \nAdvanced mode: Provides power users with an interface for firewall customization. \nPolicy-based: Allows the administrator to set and deliver a customized policy configuration for the firewall (Only available in the Business Edition). \nAll modes provide protocol filtering and intrusion detection. \n\nA powerful feature of ESET Smart Security\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Personal firewall is the ability to mark specific programs as being network-aware, in addition to web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. \n\nUsing this feature, it is possible to identify and mark an application which can be used over a network (such as Microsoft Word) for far more rigorous heuristic checking of any network connections used by the application. \n\nESET Smart Security Antispam \n\nThe Antispam feature provides a highly reliable defense against annoying spam, as well as protection against email-borne threats that share many traits with normal spam. \n\nAntispam utilizes both client- and server-based rules to provide up-to-the-minute spam prevention not attainable by other solutions requiring a continuous stream of downloads for detection. \n\nIncluded Documentation \n\nProduct Quick-Start Guide (PDF for download; printed manual for boxed version) \nIntegrated online help (accessible via the F1 key \n\nSystem Requirements \nProcessors supported: \n- 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) IntelÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, AMDÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or 100% compatible \nOperating Systems: \n- Microsoft WindowsÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2000 \n- Microsoft Windows XP (32 and 64-bit editions) \n- Microsoft Windows VistaÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® (32 and 64-bit editions) \nMemory: 35 - 40 MB, on average \nDisk Space (download): 18 MB \nDisk Space (installation): 40 MB \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.eset.com/smartsecurity/index.php?s=home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.eset.com/smartsecurity/index.php?s=home&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb2e9fdb1233c11721bf5d6375865b421c40f9e4","amp;dn":"ESET+Smart+Security+Home+Edition+3.0.56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb2e9fdb1233c11721bf5d6375865b421c40f9e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,46,159,219,18,51,193,23,33,191,93,99,117,134,91,66,28,64,249,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
