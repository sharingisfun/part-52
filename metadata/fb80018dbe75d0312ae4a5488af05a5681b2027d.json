Secretly Plotting Your Burial is the brain child of Jake Karns and John Black both of the Oil City area in Northwestern PA. After several years of playing with a full band, John and I continued to write music on the side. As time passed, and our song bank became larger, we began playing acoustic sets just for the sake of playing out. Eventually, we decided that our acoustic set sounded pretty good and decided to make it into a full time project. Our music is a little different from traditional acoustic projects. We try to bring out emotion and aggression in our songwriting and we try to create an acoustic sound that still keeps an edge. The content of our music is often considered dark and somewhat vulgar. We believe that our music is real. We believe that although it may not be everyone&amp;#039;s cup of tea, and although we aren&amp;#039;t the most talented musicians, our music will still speak to people on some level. Because it&amp;#039;s honest, and honesty is important, no matter how brutal it can be.\n\n\nfor fans of: say anything, alkaline trio, brand new, etc...\n\ninfluenced by: trail of dead, okkervil river, menomena, the pAper chAse\n\nthanks for downloading\nplease reseed\n\nand feel free to contact us and whore us.\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;761c171d131d17041805361e19021b171f1a5815191b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb80018dbe75d0312ae4a5488af05a5681b2027d","amp;dn":"Secretly+Plotting+Your+Burial+-+The+Devil+Asked+Me+Nicely","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb80018dbe75d0312ae4a5488af05a5681b2027d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,128,1,141,190,117,208,49,42,228,165,72,138,240,90,86,129,178,2,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
