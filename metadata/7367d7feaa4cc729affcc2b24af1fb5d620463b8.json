He and his team of medical doctors try to cure very ill ordinary people in the United States of America.\n\n\n--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile driving a car with her husband Sean, the pregnant Naomi Randolph collapses and is moved to House&amp;#039;s hospital. Edward Vogler is forcing the dismissal of House, pressing the board with his investment of one hundred million dollars in the hospital. The team finds that Naomi has small-cell lung cancer, needing to be submitted to radiation, but she refuses the caesarean section and the treatment to give a better chance of survival to the baby. Meanwhile, the baby of a young couple is losing weight, and House finds that the baby is being fed by the vegetarian parents only with a vegan diet. The direction of the hospital calls the social service and the police and the parents are arrested. \n\nWhile House and his team scramble to discover what&amp;#039;s causing brain and kidney dysfunction in a pregnant woman, Vogler is on the warpath to get House fired. Clinic Cases: Baby girl Olive Kaplan has pneumonia from vegan parents feeding him a vegetarian diet. After the baby starts getting better, Cuddy gets the parents arrested for starving their child.\n\n--- info ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\naudio codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3, 48000Hz  131 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo LAME3.90\n\ncideo codec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 1\n\nresolution: 624 x 352 pix\n\nsize: 349 MB (or 357,696 KB or 366,280,704 bytes)\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0606013/\n\nOriginal air date: 19 April 2005 (Season 1, Episode 18)\n\n\n--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, I didn&amp;#039;t make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. \nBut like a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or \nrarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. \nSo I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.\n\nThere will probably be more....\n\n\n__Razer__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7367d7feaa4cc729affcc2b24af1fb5d620463b8","amp;dn":"House+MD+-+118+-+Babies+%26+Bathwater.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7367d7feaa4cc729affcc2b24af1fb5d620463b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,103,215,254,170,76,199,41,175,252,194,178,74,241,251,93,98,4,99,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
