The same track and also another entitled &quot;Night Loss&quot; (which I enjoy more than &quot;Save Me&quot; were released on the most distinguished Bedrock Records label.\n\nIn any case, you can find out more information about Guy J, who hails from the beautiful land of Israel, here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/guyj1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/guyj1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHeavy but very sophisticated tech elements and steady progressive pace with a mid-way break down for the Original.\n\nSensuality, longing and well constructed progressive drive for the DJ Yellow remix.\n\n\n\nThere is one more post to follow for today.\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n\nthemagicke\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&lt;/a&gt;\n                             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07e073cb88d60e1bcf0f4b25ec866f0f59a3ebb8","amp;dn":"Guy+J+-+Been+Here+Before+2007+%5BST%5D+%5BProgressive+House%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07e073cb88d60e1bcf0f4b25ec866f0f59a3ebb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,224,115,203,136,214,14,27,207,15,75,37,236,134,111,15,89,163,235,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
