It was released before defenders, but after slayer. Whips at this point I&amp;#039;d estimate were 8mil or so, and granite mauls were still significantly priced. Fear Figment pks in this video as a sub 10 defense pure, using entangle and whipping. The video embodies everything that was beautiful about pure pking from a time when the wilderness itself still had a very &amp;#039;pure&amp;#039; atmosphere. This video is from a time where the huge No Honor movement was no where in site. Honor was about honor -- not about &amp;#039;safing&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;rushing&amp;#039; -- these terms didn&amp;#039;t exist. People understood what the wilderness was about, and there was little to no ego drama. The making of a pk video was not approached as an art form, and the products emerging were largely undeveloped, unedited, and immature in nature. Fear Figment and Cha0s Pur3 approached making this video for one of the first times in Runescape Pking history with the seriousness needed to blow people away. It is still very watchable, despite action that now would be considered very weak. It is just presented in a timeless manner. This is perhaps the most progressive video to ever be produced, and it inspired countless future imitations.\n\n--\n\nSeeded by Doodlepieguy.
