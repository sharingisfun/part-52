It is just under 10 minutes long.\n\nElvian is a very unique runepure. He is 99 str with 60 attack. This puts him at the bottom combat level available to a maxed strength runepure, at 91 combat. He uses zerker ring as well as vengance, and you can see him hit as high as 40 with dragon scimitar! The beauty of this video however is in combos he pulls off with dds, which are like nothing ever seen in a runepure video. This film was released in late &amp;#039;07, but is already a classic among runepure videos. While many people imagined the runepure would die after the release of piety, Elvian managed to prove that there was still life in the category -- granted that the runepure did not get attack.\n\n--\n\nDoodle can be contacted on the forums of Runevillage.com via PM, under the user name &amp;#039;Doodle&amp;#039;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:278f269e6f9a63f4ad4b5b28d0cc0d8daf15f415","amp;dn":"Elvian%5C%27s+Fifth+Runescape+PK+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"278f269e6f9a63f4ad4b5b28d0cc0d8daf15f415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,143,38,158,111,154,99,244,173,75,91,40,208,204,13,141,175,21,244,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
