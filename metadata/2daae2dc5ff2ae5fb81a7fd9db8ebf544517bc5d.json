The actual story of the movie concerns the tension between Zoro's passion for his art and his personal life, particularly his strained relationship with fellow artist Rose. But this isn't why one watches Wild Style--this movie is *the* classic hip-hop flick, full of great subway shots, breakdancing, freestyle MCing and rare footage of one of the godfathers of hip-hop, Grandmaster Flash, pulling off an awesome scratch-mix set on a pair of ancient turntables. A must-see for anyone interested in hip-hop music and culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2daae2dc5ff2ae5fb81a7fd9db8ebf544517bc5d","amp;dn":"Wild+Style_Eng.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2daae2dc5ff2ae5fb81a7fd9db8ebf544517bc5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,170,226,220,95,242,174,95,184,26,127,217,219,142,191,84,69,23,188,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
