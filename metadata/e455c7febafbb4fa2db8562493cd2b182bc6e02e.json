But for teacher Tom Ellison, Quest was \nmore than just an outdoor program.  It was an opportunity to conduct his own \nprivate brand of sex education with a continuing supply of female students.\n\nFor many Quest students, massages, skinny-dipping, and sexually charged comments \nfrom teachers were simply the expected.  Many students were ferociously devoted \nto the charismatic teacher, so Tom  had his pick of girls to experience their \nfirst &quot;love&quot; with him. For other teachers in the school and for parents, the \nrumours about Quest and its three male leaders were better left alone.\n\nSchool of Secrets is a story of self-redemption for those women, who after \nyears of tormented silence, decided to come forward. This riveting documentary \ntraces the outcome of the complaints filed to the Vancouver Sex Crimes Unit and \nthe investigation that brought Ellison to trial in the fall of 2006. It also \ndelves into the cautionary implications for the parents, the school and the \ncommunity that turned a deaf ear to the rumours.\n\nSchool of Secrets is produced and directed by Melanie Wood and produced by \nEunice Lee, of Bossy Boots Productions &amp; Stranger Productions (Vancouver). The \nfilm was commissioned by CBC Newsworld and is a world television premiere.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
