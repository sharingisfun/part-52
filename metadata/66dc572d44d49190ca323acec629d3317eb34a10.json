This component is in fact an improved version of the award-winning scanning engine of NOD32 Antivirus v2.7. With respect to program&amp;#039;s unprecedented scanning speed, the following improvements have been made:\n? Improved system of cleaning and deleting infiltrations. The antivirus system now intelligently cleans and deletes infiltrations with no need for user interaction.\n? Computer scan can be run in background in order to use only a part of system resources. Thus scanning will not affect the\nperformance of your computer and you will be able to work on it as usual.\n? The resident protection supports archive scanning.\n? Update optimization, smaller update package size than in version 2.7, more effective management and protection of update files against damage.\n? Email protection for users of Outlook Express. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nI will seed for as long as possible\nPlease seed after download, nobody likes a leecher\n\nThis is an update from my previous upload.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66dc572d44d49190ca323acec629d3317eb34a10","amp;dn":"ESET+Smart+Security+3.0.566+%2B+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66dc572d44d49190ca323acec629d3317eb34a10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,220,87,45,68,212,145,144,202,50,58,206,198,41,211,49,126,179,74,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
