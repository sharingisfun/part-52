Rating:  3.6 / 5 (based on 9 ratings). What did you think of it?  \n\nPlot: The far east meets the old west in this fun-filled adventure about a lovable rogue (Sammo Hung) and an incorruptible sheriff (Yuen Biao) who come together to face an explosion of brawls, bandits and bordellos, before teaming up to save their town. \n \nOverview: Sammo plays a shady businessman who has plans to revive the town of Hanshui, in which he grew up in. Biao plays the law of the town who is not only suspicious of Sammo but must also catch some bank robbers. Speeding towards Hanshui is the Shanghai Express, a train containing many wealthy people. The train is not only the target of Sammo&amp;#039;s plans but also a gang of train robbers. In the end the factions, including some Japanese, must combine together to stop the train robbers. An excellent film with many hilarious moments and some great fights including a fight between Sammo and Biao. Also included in the film are plenty of familiar faces which adds to this masterpiece. \n \nCast: Sammo Hung (Kam Bo)  ||  Yuen Biao  ||  Olivia Cheng Man-Ar  ||  Eric Tsang Chi-Wai  ||  Lam Ching-Ying  ||  Kenny Bee (Chung Chun-To)  ||  Cynthia Rothrock  ||  Richard Norton  ||  Yukari Oshima  ||  Wu Ma  ||  Rosamund Kwan Chi-Lam  ||  Dick Wei  ||  Richard Ng Yil-Hon  ||  Wang Lung-Wei  ||  Yasuaki Kurata  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.541268/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.541268/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
