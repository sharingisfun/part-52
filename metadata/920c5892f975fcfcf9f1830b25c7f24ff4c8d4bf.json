It helps you configure your MFTs (Master File Tables - the place where \ninformation about every file and directory on an NTFS hard drive is stored) and paging files (a hidden file on your\n computer\\\\\\&amp;#039;s hard disk that Windows XP &amp; Vista uses as if it were RAM) as recommended by Microsoft. Following these\n guidelines will help you keep these critical system files working their best. Your system will not slow down from \nfragmented MFT\\\\\\&amp;#039;s or paging files.\n\nFrag Shield 2.0 is comprised of two components: the MFT configuration tool and the paging file configuration tool.\n These tools allow you to set up your MFT\\\\\\&amp;#039;s and paging files so that fragmentation will be very unlikely to occur\n in the future. \n\n\n                              What is fragmentation?\n\nDisk fragmentation occurs when a file is broken up into pieces to fit on the disk. Because files are constantly \nbeing written, deleted and resized, fragmentation is a natural occurrence. When a file is spread out over several\n locations, it takes longer to read and write. But the effects of fragmentation are far more widespread: Slow \nperformance, long boot-times, random crashes and freeze-ups ? even a complete inability to boot up at all. \nMany users blame these problems on the operating systems, when disk fragmentation is often the real culprit.\n\nAll systems suffer from disk fragmentation. Diskeeper solves this problem and keeps PCs humming at their peak\nperformance.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:920c5892f975fcfcf9f1830b25c7f24ff4c8d4bf","amp;dn":"Diskeeper+PRO+PREMIER+2008+VISTA+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"920c5892f975fcfcf9f1830b25c7f24ff4c8d4bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,12,88,146,249,117,252,252,249,241,131,11,37,199,242,79,244,200,212,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
