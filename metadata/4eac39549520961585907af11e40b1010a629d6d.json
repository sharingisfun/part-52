Music was performed under name Bullmark - Salazar on bass, Santana-alumni Tom Coster on keyboards, and Bryan Mantia, who has played with Primus and Guns N&amp;#039; Roses, on drums. The soundtrack recreated the funk sound of 70&amp;#039;s film and television theme music. The soundtrack was recorded using vintage instruments and recording technology in order to as closely reproduce this sound as possible. Activision released separate official soundtrack CD which contained all tracks from the game and unreleased tracks from the recording session.\n\n1. Interstate &amp;#039;76 Theme (1:00) \n2.
