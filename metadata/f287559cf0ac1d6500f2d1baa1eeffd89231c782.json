Under\ndevelopment for several years and created using\nACID, the album has come full circle. From its\ninception as Space Cowboy Blues to the many\nintermediate iterations, FADED GALLERIA is\npresented in high quality 320kbs mp3 format!\n\nIt has been a long journey, but I make my debut\namong the BitTorrent community. While I wish\neveryone enjoyed the music equally, I\nunderstand that not everyone will understand or\nlike it. My source of inspiration? Besides the\nmyriad of artists who have come before me, I\njust simply create things that I like to listen\nto. Disc 1 is the A-Side, the part that I first\nworked under as SPACE COWBOY BLUES. Disc 2 is\nthe B-Sides. Stuff that came after finishing\nSCB, stuff from incomplete projects, as well\nas an important breakthrough. Namely, &quot;The\nDeath of Chewbacca&quot; which was the development\nname for my AP Music Theory Final. I once\nhoped to have a live recording, but things\nhave developed in a way that I couldn't find\nthe time for it to be pperformed, or at least\nperformed well. The song on thisalbum is the\nfinal MIDI render, presented in high quality\nthe same as the rest of the songs. I ask my\nlisteners only to understand the circumstance\nand fill in the holes.\n\nOn another note, there are several guest\nartists that I have taken the liberty to\nremix (some more than others). Some have made\nit into ACIDplanet contests, others have not.\nIn the end, this is all about sonic\nemmersion. I hope everyone enjoys it as much\nas I enjoyed creating it! I look forward to\nfeedback!!!\n\nJARETH KANEMERE\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0c676d626961697e694c637c7863626065626922626978&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f287559cf0ac1d6500f2d1baa1eeffd89231c782","amp;dn":"Faded+Galleria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f287559cf0ac1d6500f2d1baa1eeffd89231c782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,135,85,156,240,172,29,101,0,242,209,186,161,238,255,216,146,49,199,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
