Like those films, it combines high-kicking martial arts with comic-book plotting and a dollop of B-movie sleaziness. It features regular Chiba sidekick Sue Shiomi as Tina Long, a tough martial arts expert who agrees to go undercover for the Hong Kong police when her policeman brother, Lee (Hiroshi Miyauchi), disappears during an anti-drug operation. She enlists the help of her brother's karate school, which includes the expert fighter Sonny Kawasaka (Chiba). Together, Tina and Sonny go up against a formidable drug lord and an army of martial artists, each with their own deadly skill. In the process, she uncovers some dark secrets about her family. Star Sue Shiomi continued to star in martial arts films and later revived the Tina Long character in two sequels.\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073714/\nIMDb Rating: 5.8/10 (295 votes)\n\nDirector: Kazuhiko Yamaguchi\n\nCast:\nSue Shiomi ....
