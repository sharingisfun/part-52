And finally I made it.\nI am starting with my own remix of well known Frankie Valli&amp;#039;s - Beggin (pilooski edit).\nBored of hearing it again and again at the radio I decided to give it a new \nprogressive essaince by mixing it. What&amp;#039;s more? Lot&amp;#039;s of nice vocal songs very well known and soundtracks that never die!\nI tried to use remixes that are not heard much on the radio and as always I have installed my personal touch by working \non the interconnections of the tracks for hours and hours trying to add riffs and beats to differ of the originals.\nMy gf after listening a pre-beta of this mix said that she felt like hearing a one track composition. \nSo I think I am delivering you my friends another magik musical journey.\n\n\tKeep travelling, sharing music and have fun!\n\t\n23 tracks in playlist, average track length: 3:31\nPlaylist length: 1 hour 21 minutes 1 second \n\nPlaylist files:\n\n1.
