You see, It&amp;#039;s not the radiation that will kill you, it&amp;#039;s the blast! So stop worrying about it, go outside 3 minutes after the blast and eat all you want! Don&amp;#039;t read those (great) newspaper ads warning about radiation! Don&amp;#039;t listen to the radio! And don&amp;#039;t worry about your hair, it&amp;#039;ll grow back, and besides, you can always wear a toupee! Pretty amazing.\n\nThe naration is alternately patronizing and clueless, making this a highly amusing example of 50s cold war propaganda.\n\n\n*Aspects of Nuclear Radiation (1950&amp;#039;s propaganda)\n\nThis film tries to dispell fear of nuclear radiation by such tactics as portraying the human body as a factory run by pixies, telling you you can always get a toupee if your hair falls out, and informing you that you&amp;#039;ll be dead before getting a high enough dose of radiation to make you sterile. The naration is alternately patronizing and clueless, making this a highly amusing example of 50s cold war propaganda.\n\n\n*Mythbusters: The Effects of Radiation on the Body\n\nOur physics assignment about the effects of radiation on the body.
