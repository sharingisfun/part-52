An old shepherd and his little Skye terrier go to Edinburgh. But when the shepherd dies of pneumonia, the dog remains faithful to his master, refuses to be adopted by anyone, and takes to sleeping on his master&amp;#039;s grave in the Greyfriars kirkyard, despite a caretaker with a &quot;no dogs&quot; rule. And when Bobby is taken up for being unlicensed, it&amp;#039;s up to the children of Edinburgh and the Lord Provost to decide what&amp;#039;s to be done.
