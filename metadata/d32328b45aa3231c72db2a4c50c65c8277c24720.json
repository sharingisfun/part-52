Uthur Pendragon is given the mystical sword Excalibur by the wizard Merlyn. At his death Uthur buries the sword into a stone, and the next man that can pull it out will be King of England. Years later Arthur, Uthur\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s bastard son draws Excalibur and becomes king. Guided by Merlyn, Arthur marries Guenivere and gathers the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s evil half-sister Morgana sires a son with him, who may prove his downfall.

It is there in Arthur\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s glory years and in his decline, brought on by the love affair between his wife Guenevere and best friend and best knight Sir Lancelot, the Holy Grail Quest which produces many casualties among the knights, and the arrival of Mordred, the son Arthur had by his evil half-sister, the sorceress Morgana. Through it all, the magician Merlin watches over everything, always ready to throw in a Charm of Making when it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s called for.
