It became home to several hundred African immigrants.\n\nIt had a reputation for crime, drugs and prostitution, and is a constant source of angry complaints from local Italian residents.\n\nAfter riots in 2006, an apartheid-style wall?a ring of steel-- separated it from the neighborhood and now finally it is empty. But the controversy rages on. \n\nCountless millions of poor Italians emigrated around the world. Now the shoe is on the other foot. \n\nNow Italy needs cheap labor but no comprehensive laws allow the needed migrants to be integrated in an orderly, legal fashion.\n\nThere are 1.6 African migrants in a population of 60 million. Is the issue purely racism?\n\nGhettos develop and crime hotspots disturb local areas and like elsewhere it is a hot button issue without the political will for a solution.
