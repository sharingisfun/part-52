Although coming from a small country, he won worldwide acclaim in the &amp;#039;60s for the music he wrote for films like &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; and &quot;Stella&quot;. \nHere, as a tribute, K.B. transforms some of Hadjidakis&amp;#039;s tunes into electronic and drum &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; bass chill-out sounds.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s sweet, melodic, maybe a bit ethnic. Worth the try if you&amp;#039;re looking for something different.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e456d7c397d4cc439b3b61447d3b9ac4269e77df","amp;dn":"Transformations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e456d7c397d4cc439b3b61447d3b9ac4269e77df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,86,215,195,151,212,204,67,155,59,97,68,125,59,154,196,38,158,119,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
