The DVD features as its centerpiece a rollicking and emotive 60 minute concert performance filmed live from London&amp;#039;s 104 year old Sheperd&amp;#039;s Bush Empire. For Amy Winehouse fans, I Told You I Was Trouble also serves up a potpourri of bonus material including a 50 minute film chronicling her incredible rise as one of music&amp;#039;s most colorful and acclaimed new voices; never-before-seen early performances; an interview with her father, and other rare, behind the scenes glimpses of the British siren. Showcasing her hit songs from her UK debut release Frank and the international platinum-plus release Back To Black (recently passing the 3 million sales milestone worldwide), the concert from Sheperd&amp;#039;s Bush features &quot;You Know I&amp;#039;m No Good,&quot; &quot;Tears Dry On Their Own&quot;, Amy&amp;#039;s cover of the Zuton&amp;#039;s &quot;Valerie&quot;, and her Billboard topping hit &quot;Rehab,&quot; among others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3730b2392e94a65787826af3153bc83531da90","amp;dn":"Amy+Winehouse%3A+I+Told+You+I+Was+Trouble+Live+In+London+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3730b2392e94a65787826af3153bc83531da90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,55,48,178,57,46,148,166,87,135,130,106,243,21,59,200,53,49,218,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
