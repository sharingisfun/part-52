Taped from TV, edited out commercials and then put on DVD.  If you are a collector this is not for you.  If you want to watch the movie, this may be the right one.\n\nNTSC-English only.\n\nThis is a re-upload of the original that was at: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3431514/Then_Came_Bronson.  I deleted the original torrent file so I can&amp;#039;t re-seed (or figure out how to).  Smooth huh?\n\nI&amp;#039;m going to super-seed this for a few days only on request and then it&amp;#039;s up to you guys to keep it going.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02072d55a88c2fb4b5c6bf827993ff91d2fba0a1","amp;dn":"Then+Came+Bronson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02072d55a88c2fb4b5c6bf827993ff91d2fba0a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,7,45,85,168,140,47,180,181,198,191,130,121,147,255,145,210,251,160,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
