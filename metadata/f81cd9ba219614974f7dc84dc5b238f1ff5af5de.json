The most radical aspect is the lighting, where the shadows are sometimes more important than the actors. \n\nAlso unusual is that there are no titles except at the start to introduce the characters, who are just types and do not have names, just descriptive titles (husband, wife, youth, servant, etc.). \n\nThe shadow puppet show is similar to what is seen more extensively in Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed, Die (1925).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81cd9ba219614974f7dc84dc5b238f1ff5af5de","amp;dn":"Schatten+aka+Warning+Shadows+-+silent+expressionist+classic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81cd9ba219614974f7dc84dc5b238f1ff5af5de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,28,217,186,33,150,20,151,79,125,200,77,197,178,56,241,255,90,245,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
