They seemed to generate magical armies from the surrounding air in the hands of powerful wizards. In the quickly-bloating, copycat real-time strategy genre, Blood and Magic is an anomaly. It doesn&amp;#039;t look like many other games, and it doesn&amp;#039;t play like them either. In addition, it is based on an actual story line (TSR&amp;#039;s Forgotten Realms, familiar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons players and avid fantasy readers), and displays more creativity than duplication. Finally, the interface, look, and feel are both delightful and refreshing, and the game in general is quite refreshing.\n\n-----\nThis torrent http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3825118/Blood__amp__Magic is dead, so I decided to put B&amp;M again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:761bd337abc7e352cca43dd33653aa00f5db7f0c","amp;dn":"Blood+%26+Magic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"761bd337abc7e352cca43dd33653aa00f5db7f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,27,211,55,171,199,227,82,204,164,61,211,54,83,170,0,245,219,127,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
