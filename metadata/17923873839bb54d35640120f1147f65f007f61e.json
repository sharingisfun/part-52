Thankfully that&amp;#039;s the most tasteless part of the project as the rest is highly ingenious and promising. The band is a quartet based in Ontario playing Irish and Scots instrumental tunes and their own vocal and tune material. They are quick on pace changes within a set from reel to jig and back again as in &amp;#039;Hag at the Churn&amp;#039;, displaying an ability to reroute before returning to main theme something akin to The Tannahill Weavers. However this Canadian outfit&amp;#039;s musical strains are less obviously boisterous and subtler with clever balance of pipes, fiddle and stringed instruments. There is a good proportion of original songs with five songs written by Ed Nicol with strong vocal harmonies and sounding not unlike Spirit of the West.
