Two discs. The fourth (and last) series is on the way. The 1st and 2nd series can be found here:\n\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3339818\n\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3349517 \n\nThe first three episodes of this third series of Jeeves &amp; Wooster take place in Manhattan. In spite of the change of scene, our hero continues to get into the most terrible scrapes, and it falls to the faithful Jeeves to save the day, frequently. When he realises that Honoria Glossop may once again have her sights set on his precious bachelorhood, Bertie Wooster sets sail for the New World. Here he helps old pal Tuppy to make a business deal. At the same time he has to keep Motty Malvern on the straight and narrow, while helping two writer friends deceive their prying relatives. The final straw comes in the shape of Cyril Bassington-Bassington, the stage-struck son of Aunt Agatha's closest friend.\n\nBack home in England, Bertie and Gussie Fink-Nottle switch identities, the lunatic Roderick Spode reappears, Bertie is forced to commit burglary (again!), and there's a spot of trouble with a tin of treacle and some communists. The unflappable Jeeves is Bertie's only hope. Although the humour in this collection sometimes feels a little less assured than in earlier episodes and the new actor playing Gussie is a disappointment, the central performances of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are as good as ever. Few actors have ever brought such beloved characters so convincingly to life.\n\nEnjoy - and remember plz seed;-)\n\n\n/Fidelio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1dc167bc3059ed9ab8becfd57b1fb419117b0a","amp;dn":"Jeeves.And.Wooster.Series3.DVDR-Fidelio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1dc167bc3059ed9ab8becfd57b1fb419117b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,29,193,103,188,48,89,237,154,184,190,207,213,123,31,180,25,17,123,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
