Some have lost arms or legs, others suffer from blindness or trauma. Hailed as heroes at home, the soldiers in Purple Hearts speak longingly of a desire to return to duty. Yet their future remains problematic, as American society grows increasingly ambivalent about the war and the military fails to create a place for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07839dd88f1566b9dc0ed5dbb057ea5f7f5a8a11","amp;dn":"Purple+Hearts+tvrip+-+INFOFALLOUT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07839dd88f1566b9dc0ed5dbb057ea5f7f5a8a11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,131,157,216,143,21,102,185,220,14,213,219,176,87,234,95,127,90,138,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
