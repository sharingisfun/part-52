It was released following the success of the Kicking Pigeons EP pressed a year earlier that sold 5000 copies to early followers at pub gigs.\n\nThe first 3,000 copies of the album included a five track bonus CD of live recordings. The standard album was re-released in December 2000 as a limited edition digipak without the bonus tracks. In 2004, the album was again re-released as a limited edition in a slipcase. The bonus tracks were bundled back onto this version, plus a rare demo of \\\\\\&amp;#039;Make Me Happy\\\\\\&amp;#039; and an enhanced video of \\\\\\&amp;#039;Kicking Pigeons\\\\\\&amp;#039;.\n\nNo singles were ever released from Pedigree Chump. However, the song \\\\\\&amp;#039;Kicking Pigeons\\\\\\&amp;#039; can be found on the Kicking Pigeons EP and an updated version of the same song is the second A-side on Live Another Day/Kicking Pigeons 2001, a single from their next album Room For Abuse.\n\n[edit] Track Listing (Album)\n\n   1.
