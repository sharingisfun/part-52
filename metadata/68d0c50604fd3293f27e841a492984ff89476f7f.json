Formed in 2003 by Jayson Munro with Dave Corsak on drums and Matt\nStevens on second guitar, the band&amp;#039;s lineup has evolved in dramatic\nways since then. In the fall of that year the group lost Matt and\ngained Travus Palmer. Travus started off on bass and eventually moved\nto rhythm guitar and backing vocals. After this lineup change The\nStriders have had a great number of bassists: Chris Cestari, Matt\nCorsak (Dave&amp;#039;s older brother), Rick Visser (of tapereelsforeyes.com), \nJeremy Lazaro and finally Joe Andrews.\n\nWith Joe wielding the bass The Striders have finally found their\nperfect lineup.  The group, fresh off their 2006 hiatus, return to the\nstage with a brand new EP titled &quot;Between Scylla and Charybdis&quot;.  The\nbloated seven song EP show the dream pop quartet reaching in new\ndirections.  Extending to the margins the simple clean-toned guitar\npop, The Striders move towards a more sonically open sound, with\nexperimentation and lavishly adorned textures, oozing energy from the\nedges, the group take each song to the next level; continuing their\njourney towards psychedelic dream pop ecstasy.\n\nIn short, if you like fun, well written power pop songs then this\nalbum is for you.  Get the album, be happy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68d0c50604fd3293f27e841a492984ff89476f7f","amp;dn":"The+Striders+-+Between+Scylla+and+Charybdis+EP+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68d0c50604fd3293f27e841a492984ff89476f7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,208,197,6,4,253,50,147,242,126,132,26,73,41,132,255,137,71,111,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
