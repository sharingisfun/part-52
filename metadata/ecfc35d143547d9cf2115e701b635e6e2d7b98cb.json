Ghost pirates are prowling the legendary waters of the Triangle, searching for a priceless treasure and someone on board the cruise ship may hold the secret to it&amp;#039;s location. Now Scooby and the rest of gang will have to solve the real mystery behind the mysterious treasure or they may end up walking the plank to sink to the depths of Davy Jone&amp;#039;s Locker!
