Divinefire is more Gothenburg MeloDeath with Power Metal vocals (not like Children of Bodom) meanwhile Audiovision is more regular Neoclassic Power Metal.\n\nDivinefire is a three-man band, formed exactly one year ago. The members are all in other bands, so I guess this is consider a side-project.\nExcept Rivel himself the band contains Jani Stefanovic (ex- Crimson Moonlight, Renascent, ex- Am I Blood &amp; Sins of Omission) and Andreas Olsson (Narnia, Wisdom Call &amp; Stormwind).\nBut there are also some very famous guests on this record as well; among the largest we find Eric Clayton (Saviour Machine) and Thomas Vikstr&amp;ouml;m (ex- Candelmass, Brazen Abbot).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Glory Thy NameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released in Japan during November 2004, but reached Europe last month, and the Japanese Metal fans loves it, it has become pretty huge over there, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sign we should keep in mind here.\nAnd after the first listening, I pretty much understand the Japanese's.\n\nFirst of all I have to say the music, the MeloDeath mixed with Power and Neoclassic is a great mix (even if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loosing some strength against the end), and second ChristianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very special voice, I do understand the JapaneseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfectly here.\nUnfortunately I think the material is a bit weak throughout the whole records to make it a larger hit here in Europe, but it should at least be an album thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ranked high by the press and it should sell descent too.\n\nAmong the strongest parts I have to lift forward the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SpiritÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, that I think is, by far the best song this album has to provide. The Epic touches and the Iced Earth inspired ending is creepy, and both melody and vocals are great. More songs in this class and the album would have been close to masterful.\nBut also the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never SurrenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that has the catchiest chorus I heard in a long time, I caught myself singing out loud without even knowing.\nAnother strong part is the production, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not bad at all, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not super. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so perfect that you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think about that part throughout the whole record, great work!\n\nIf you heard Narnia, then you know what ChristianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice sounds like, and if you like it, you could buy half of this without even think twice.\nBut if you takes his voice and adding some lyrics about God, Jesus and all that and putting that in a music that sounds like Epic Neoclassic MeloDeathPower Metal, then you have a clue what to expect.\nSounds interesting? Well, then try Divinefire.\n\nCheck Out: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SpiritÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live My Life for YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ &amp; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never SurrenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebec583da6df0bff40c3ef15780dac3f4c3e18ae","amp;dn":"Divinefire+-+Glory+Thy+Name","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebec583da6df0bff40c3ef15780dac3f4c3e18ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,236,88,61,166,223,11,255,64,195,239,21,120,13,172,63,76,62,24,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
