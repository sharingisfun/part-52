Black Is The Color (8:15)\n02. Good Morning! (8:46)\n03. Love Why Don&amp;#039;t You Find Us (6:09)\n04. Lovely Day (6:26)\n05. Starflight (5:46)\n\nOverall Total: 35:22\n\nInfo/Comments:\nBefore getting a request for this album, I had never heard of the artist, let alone the album.  However, a few quick Google searches turned up all I needed to find it.  This is not my rip, I just obtained it from a non-torrent source and uploaded it by request.  The ID3 tags indicate that the ripping/encoding credit goes to JUICE, and I must say, it seems to me that he did an excellent job with this vinyl.  \n\nDespite not having heard this before, I must say, I am enjoying this album.  I hope you enjoy it as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5535ce926068d15c9815835987925c9929dfacde","amp;dn":"Wilbert+Longmire+-+Sunny+Side+Up+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5535ce926068d15c9815835987925c9929dfacde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,53,206,146,96,104,209,92,152,21,131,89,135,146,92,153,41,223,172,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
