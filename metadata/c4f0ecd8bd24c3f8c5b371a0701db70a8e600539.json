The title is said to be a Springsteen quote, but the music is not Springsteenish whatsoever. Rather some experimental Beck Hansen-like rock.\n\n1. Blues for a hip king (mp3@192 kbit/s)\n2. Peace is a state of mind (mp3@192 kbit/s)\n3. Put a peephole in my brain (mp3@192 kbit/s)\n\nSpread it around, if this is their debut they&amp;#039;re bound for some good releases in the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f0ecd8bd24c3f8c5b371a0701db70a8e600539","amp;dn":"Hold+your+horses%2C+Bob%21+-+1st+single","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f0ecd8bd24c3f8c5b371a0701db70a8e600539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,240,236,216,189,36,195,248,197,179,113,160,112,29,183,10,142,96,5,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
