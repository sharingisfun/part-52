Pride\n???????287 mb\n???????rmvb\n???????????\n\n???? Pride\n\n?????????????????????????? Linus (Rupert Graves??)????????????Suki(??????)??????????????????????????????????Dark (?????????????????????????)????????????? \n\nOn a lush African savannah, a contented pride of Lions have everything they need to live ? a grove of trees for shade, a river and plentiful food. But as two young cubs, Suki and her brother Linus, play under the watchful eye of their mother Macheeba, the tranquility of the pride is cruelly disturbed by an attack from the rival Wanderers, a group of lions recently moved in to the land across the river. They are dubbed the Wanderers because they come and go and seem wild and restless. Two huge Wanderer males Dark and Harry injure a number of the Pride, and kill one of their lionesses, before being driven off by Macheeba. She takes the dead lioness's cub Fleck under her wing. Suki and Linus aren't too thrilled about sharing their mother with the orphaned Fleck, but Pride rules dictate that they must all pull together if they?re to survive. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:282dede5447f2ca88a65e963881d1165c11dfe18","amp;dn":"%3F%3F%3F%3F+Pride","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"282dede5447f2ca88a65e963881d1165c11dfe18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,45,237,229,68,127,44,168,138,101,233,99,136,29,17,101,193,29,254,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
