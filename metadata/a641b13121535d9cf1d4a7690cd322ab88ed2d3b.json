The first track is the title track and only original on the EP, it's classic Tossers, fast Irish-Punk. It later appeared on the latest album &quot;Purgatory&quot;. It also features two great up-beat covers of the traditional &quot;Dicey Rily&quot; and &quot;Donegal Danny&quot;, a beautiful cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Seven Curses&quot;, and the final track is Jerry Lee Lewis's &quot;Rockin My Life Away&quot;, pure banjo plucking bad ass boogie woogie rock'n'roll. \n\nCheers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a641b13121535d9cf1d4a7690cd322ab88ed2d3b","amp;dn":"the+tossers+-+first+league+out+from+land+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a641b13121535d9cf1d4a7690cd322ab88ed2d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,65,177,49,33,83,93,156,241,212,167,105,12,211,34,171,136,237,45,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
