They are pretty well direct playstation ports of the games, which is good since it allows pc games to play the games without emulation, but bad because they really could have improved the graphics. 2 and 3 are from my original cds, and 1 from a friends cd. I used clonecd to make the image file into cdd, but also had it make a cue file for those of you who can&amp;#039;t use ccd format. I highly recommend using a joystick for these games since none of them have mouse support.  \n\nWhats included:\nResident Evil 1\nResident Evil 2 Platinum\nResident Evil 3 Nemesis\nCovers for all three games\nManuals for all three games (note resident evil 3 manual is for psx, since I couldn&amp;#039;t find the pc manual)\n\nI have not run any of these games on my current system, but could still get resident evil 2 and 3 to run on my last video card without much problems. I believe you should not have too much trouble running these since they are all directx games, but you may have to play around with the video settings until you find a video card selection that works for you (they have you chose which video card you have to select video mode).\n\nFor those of you who are unfamilar with the stories of the game, in each game you are the lone hero in a zombie filled world. An evil corporation umbrella has created a virus which turns people into zombies. In the first game you are a member of a swat like team called Stars who is sent in to investigate this creepy old mansion. Needless to say the mission doesn&amp;#039;t go so well and you are stuck there with a bunch of zombies. \n\nIn the second story you follow the creation of the g virus which is a more powerful version of the t virus. Again things get out of control, only this time the entire city is infected. \n\nIn the third game, you play the role of a Star member again trying to escape the city. You are being chased by a virtually unstoppable creature called nemesis who will hunt you down until you die.\n\nImages here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_1_Front_Cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_1_Front_Cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_1_Back_Cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_1_Back_Cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_2_Platinum_Front_Cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_2_Platinum_Front_Cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_2_Platinum_Back_Cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_2_Platinum_Back_Cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_3_Nemesis_Front_Cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_3_Nemesis_Front_Cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_3_Nemesis_Back_Cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://b.imagehost.org/0077/Resident_Evil_3_Nemesis_Back_Cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------\nLite this kind of shit?\nWould be nice to post &quot;thank&amp;#039;s&quot; here :-D\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nPozdrawiam Jozka z Bagien, pana Kononowicza Krzysztofa i Jozka z Kobierzyna i oczywiscie Mikiego z Miralek !\nSiemaneczko !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76be533bf1905381aa1bd420626da2c35de4be83","amp;dn":"Resident.Evil.1.2.3.Special.Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76be533bf1905381aa1bd420626da2c35de4be83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,190,83,59,241,144,83,129,170,27,212,32,98,109,162,195,93,228,190,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
