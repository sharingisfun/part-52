Although The Maggie is owned by his sister, he just manages to eke out a meager living while staying one step ahead of his creditors on his beloved boat. When rich American Calvin Marshall wishes to transport material to his new house on one of the out-islands, Mactaggart manages to trick his agent into hiring The Maggie for 300 pounds, a sum that might be used for some much-needed repairs, for the job. When Marshall learns that his valuable cargo is at risk in a vessel that&amp;#039;s less than seaworthy, he does all in his power to abort the charter and have his valuable cargo transferred to a more reliable vessel. What Marshall is not prepared for is the wily Mactaggart&amp;#039;s sly delaying tactics and crafty machinations.\n\nTrivia:\n The Maggie was played by two boats in the film, the Boer and the Inca.\n\n Tommy Kearins, who plays Dougie, was selected for the role after being spotted in a Scouts &quot;Gang Show&quot;, working backstage. After being interviewed by Ealing, he spent 3 months filming on Islay. He was paid 3 times what his father made in the Clyde shipyards.\n\n Alexander Mackendrick was not personally very satisfied with the finished film as he felt that it concentrated too much on his own personal concerns and not enough on things relevant to anyone else.\n\nCast:\n\nPaul Douglas as Calvin B.
