The original members were Justin Greaves (Drums), Johnny Morrow (Vocals), Jim Rushby (Guitar), Steve Watson (Guitar) and Doug Dalziel (Bass). The members all had experience playing in the British underground and they each brought different influences to the fold. The group's sound was influenced by the doom metal and crust punk genres and in particular by bands such as Grief, Black Sabbath and Eyehategod. The end result is a ghastly combination of vitriolic aggression, downtuned riffage, huge underlying grooves and inhuman screams.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:507f2d9ed9c7a4b430f1b350ee0376b2a6b6dff0","amp;dn":"IRON+MONKEY+-+Our+Problem%5B1998%5D+%5BSludge%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"507f2d9ed9c7a4b430f1b350ee0376b2a6b6dff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,127,45,158,217,199,164,180,48,241,179,80,238,3,118,178,166,182,223,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
