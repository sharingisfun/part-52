You can, for example, create message templates, ranging from simple to sophisticated, and make macros do most of the work. Beyond the specialized functions, a variety of nice touches helps you search, sort, and manage your messages with a minimum of stress. One such feature lets you park messages, which prevents you from accidentally deleting or moving them later. Another nice perk is Virtual Folder, which lets you instantly categorize your messages without actually moving them between folders. IMAP support means you can examine, organize, and automatically filter messages on a remote mail server without downloading them. PGP support lets you send and receive PGP-signed and PGP-encrypted files without hassle. If your system administrator prohibits IM, The Bat&amp;#039;s secure chat feature makes communication faster without compromising your security. If you have complex e-mail needs, invest some time up front with The Bat and you&amp;#039;ll save yourself a lot of time down the line.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556df6fcbc314c2a678187b8aef6d9cbe48fd9c6","amp;dn":"TheBat+v3.99.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556df6fcbc314c2a678187b8aef6d9cbe48fd9c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,109,246,252,188,49,76,42,103,129,135,184,174,246,217,203,228,143,217,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
