Frosty The Snowman \n\nThis is a Canadian recording circa 1968 by a Canadian band, The Quiet Jungle.  These mp3&amp;#039;s were lifted directly from the original vinyl album.  Recorded to wav and burt to CD, they were then ripped from the CD to mp3 format.\n\nIt sounds alot like the Royal Guardsmen, but as far as I can tell, they are not the same band.  The Royal Guardsmen did later cover the first track.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!\n\nMerry Christmas!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7cad401342ac749ff4a7478cafd2d2b51ddd8d","amp;dn":"The+Quiet+Jungle+-+The+Story+of+Snoopy%5C%27s+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7cad401342ac749ff4a7478cafd2d2b51ddd8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,124,173,64,19,66,172,116,159,244,167,71,140,175,210,210,181,29,221,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
