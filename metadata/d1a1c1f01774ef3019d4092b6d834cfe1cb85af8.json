I don't usually like this kind of film, and was very sceptical about it but honestly - it ownz :P Too many great moments to count. Favourite one is probably still when the huge matllic-y alien stomps up to the archaeology professor, who - trying desperately to understand what it is he is seeing - asks the only question any intellectual could think of had it happened to them in the 1940s &quot;Are... are you... German!?&quot; :-D\n\nLittle over 210MB, encoded cropped WS @ 175kbps video and mono sound. I.e. not for the home theater system, but great for a limited PocketPC memory card.\n\nPM me if you're into that sort of thing, I know I am :-)\n\nPeace,\n\n/W","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1a1c1f01774ef3019d4092b6d834cfe1cb85af8","amp;dn":"The.5th.Element.PocketPC.xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1a1c1f01774ef3019d4092b6d834cfe1cb85af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,161,193,240,23,116,239,48,25,212,9,43,109,131,76,254,28,184,90,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
