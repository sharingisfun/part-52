The other band members then appear on their respective screens and the song starts.The whole illusion is weird and delightful, and reminds me of the effects in &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. If you're a Gorillaz fan, you need to see this. It's trippy. \nThe clip also features two live Asian rappers performing onstage and a few shots of dancing audience members. \nThe clip has a TV station watermark in the upper left-hand corner that reads &quot;China Plus&quot;, but it is small and unobtrusive. I'm assuming it was broadcast on TV. This clip may be from the Gorillaz DVD 'Celebrity Takedown', but I don't know for certain. \n\nVideo: DivX 5 720x416 24.99fps 1284Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 128Kbps\nTime:  4:12.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f4620b4618fec7dc6e7426ca343e207a730f576","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+%5C%27Live%5C%27+Concert+Clip--Clint+Eastwood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f4620b4618fec7dc6e7426ca343e207a730f576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,70,32,180,97,143,236,125,198,231,66,108,163,67,226,7,167,48,245,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
