I made this Image with Nero, but you can use any program to burn it, as long as it burns image files.    You can play it on PS2 assuming you have a ps2 that has a MOD-CHIP or you are using a SWAP DISC and some kind of boot method. It includes 2 Cdr images which both have 474 games on each cd a total of 948 games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87400bd48fab2d15b9fbd9b7b582e4b930eda6b7","amp;dn":"Sega+Genesis%28PGEN%29+for+PS2%2F2+CDr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87400bd48fab2d15b9fbd9b7b582e4b930eda6b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,64,11,212,143,171,45,21,185,251,217,183,181,130,228,185,48,237,166,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
