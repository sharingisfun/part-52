The group was formed on the    |\n|  campus of Kentucky Christian College by lead vocalist Mark Stuart,        |\n|  guitarist Barry Blair, bassist Will McGinnis, keyboardist Bob Herdman     |\n|  and drummer Brian Hayes; originally named A-180, they recorded an         |\n|  independent single, &quot;My God,&quot; which caught the attention of Forefront     |\n|  Records president Dan Brock, and soon after the label issued Audio        |\n|  Adrenaline's self-titled debut LP. Don't Censor Me followed in 1993,      |\n|  scoring hits with the singles &quot;Big House&quot; and &quot;Can't Take God Away;&quot;      |\n|  after 1995's Live Bootleg, the band resurfaced a year later with Bloom,   |\n|  which debuted in the Top 60 on the Billboard pop charts. In 1997, Audio   |\n|  Adrenaline &amp;ugrave; now consisting of Stuart, McGinnis, Herdman and drummer Ben  |\n|  Cissell &amp;ugrave; resurfaced with Some Kind of Zombie; Underdog followed two      |\n|  years later. A greatest hits collection, Hit Parade, celebrated almost    |\n|  ten years in the music industry, and served as a good introduction to     |\n|  the band. Lift came out the following year.                               |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeee13d3452690fe38d74baba9b1beabf1fcf693","amp;dn":"Audio_Adrenaline-Until_My_Heart_Caves_In_%28Advance%29-2005-KSi+%5BAlt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeee13d3452690fe38d74baba9b1beabf1fcf693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,238,19,211,69,38,144,254,56,215,75,171,169,177,190,171,241,252,246,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
