For this reason, we recommend you do NOT use it to encode audiobooks, or other material consisting entirely of speech (Speex, which we also have released as a torrent, is the best codec to use for speech endoding).\n\nMusepack plug-ins are available for most popular audio players, including Foobar2000.\n\nIf you dislike using command-line encoders, a couple Windows frontends are available, and the excellent CD ripper EAC can also be configured to use MusePack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b37185ba68dfbdc05a9d96c9216e49b97646afc6","amp;dn":"MusePack+1.15v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b37185ba68dfbdc05a9d96c9216e49b97646afc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,113,133,186,104,223,189,192,90,157,150,201,33,110,73,185,118,70,175,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
