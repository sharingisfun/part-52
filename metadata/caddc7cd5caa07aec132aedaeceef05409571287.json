Tommy and Sincere have been able to move out of the ghetto in Queens where they were raised and relocate to an upscale section of Manhattan; they would seem to have it made, but both realize that their lives are headed toward a dead end. Sincere begins getting in touch with his African roots and tries to convince his girlfriend Tionne that they should emigrate to the Motherland, while Tommy has a religious awakening and joins the Nation of Islam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caddc7cd5caa07aec132aedaeceef05409571287","amp;dn":"Belly+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caddc7cd5caa07aec132aedaeceef05409571287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,221,199,205,92,170,7,174,193,50,174,218,236,238,240,84,9,87,18,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
