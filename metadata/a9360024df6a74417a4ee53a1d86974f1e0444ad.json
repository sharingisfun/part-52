Someone who \nlearned first hand is Philip Winslow, a former United Nations relief worker. \nHe spent almost three years from 2001 and 2004, during the second Palestinian \nintifada, trying to mediate the daily disputes at military checkpoints and \nrefugee camps. His job was to escort Palestinians and aid through the \ncheckpoints.\n\nWinslow, who is an American, wrote a book about the experience. The book&amp;#039;s \ntitle is: Victory For Us is to See you Suffer: In the West Bank with the \nPalestinians and the Israelis . It&amp;#039;s a controversial look at two societies \nlocked in a destructive struggle. Brian met Winslow many years ago when they \nwere both young reporters. Winslow had a long career working as both a \ntelevision and radio foreign correspondent before becoming a relief worker.\n\nHistory, as usual, is the key to understanding the conflict in the Middle East. \nWe also present a documentary, rich with archival footage, by the CBC&amp;#039;s Don \nMurray about how Britain&amp;#039;s Balfour Declaration in 1917 first conceived of a \nstate, now called Israel, inside territory long regarded, in the Middle East, \nas Palestinian.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
