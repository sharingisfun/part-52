The installer just copies the files over and adds a destop link, without messing about with the registry. Everything is contained within the program directory and to uninstall you just delete the program&amp;#039;s directory - no files left all over your Windows installation. It&amp;#039;s small and fast, not at all bloated like many burning applications. \n\nAbsolutely no malware, spyware, trojans etc and 100% clean. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.burrrn.net/?page_id=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.burrrn.net/?page_id=4&lt;/a&gt; \n\nBurn audio CDs the easy way! \n\nBurrrn is a little tool for creating audio CDs with CD-Text from \nvarious audio files. \n\nSupported formats are: wav, mp3, mpc, ogg, aac, mp4, ape, flac, ofr, \nwv, tta, m3u, pls and fpl playlists and cue sheets. You can also burn \nEAC&amp;#039;s noncompliant image + cue sheets! Burrrn can read all types of \ntags from all these formats (including ape tags in mp3). Burrrn uses \ncdrdao.exe for burning. \n\nMulti-language support included.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3846f55ab5fd7a4a808b1e151add1e8c0eda3596","amp;dn":"Burrrn+Audio+CD+Maker+%28unofficial+update%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3846f55ab5fd7a4a808b1e151add1e8c0eda3596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,70,245,90,181,253,122,74,128,139,30,21,26,221,30,140,14,218,53,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
