Andrew Keen asserts that the same riddle can be applied to Web 2.0. While new Internet technology has revolutionized traditional media and allows everyone to be writer/creator, if everyone is writer/creator, then just who is left to listen to the cacophony?\n\nAbout the author:\nAndrew Keen?s deeply controversial Cult of the Amateur (to be published June 5, 2007) is the first book that exposes the economic, ethical and social dangers of the Web 2.0 revolution. Andrew hasn?t always been a contrarian. In the mid-Nineties, he was a member of that generation of Silicon Valley visionaries who pioneered the Internet. He founded Audiocafe.com in 1995 and established it as one of the most highly trafficked websites of the late Nineties. Today, he is the host of the Internet chat show afterTV.com and regularly appears on the web, television and radio. His work can be found on his CultoftheAmateur blog, his syndicated Podtech video-essay, his ZDNet column as well as in traditional publications.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28f7eefe31da9c8943cf95e93b7174e61efea840","amp;dn":"Against+You+A+Manifesto+in+Favor+of+Audience+%28PDF%29%28Manifesto%29+-L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28f7eefe31da9c8943cf95e93b7174e61efea840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,247,238,254,49,218,156,137,67,207,149,233,59,113,116,230,30,254,168,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
