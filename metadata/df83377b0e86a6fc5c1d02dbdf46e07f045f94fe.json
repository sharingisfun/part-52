I spent some weeks editing, but since my PC is &quot;old school&quot; its hard to record with low fps, and rendering takes ages. So, after a few weeks my first video is done. Don&amp;#039;t expect some insane skills like Neilyo, Ming,  Mute etc etc etc... If you do, you can as well just skip the movie. I&amp;#039;d like to read some progressive critics, so I know what i should do and what i shouldn&amp;#039;t do in my next movie. \n  The fights are recorded during the HARP age, and after the nerf when i use Shadowstep. I don&amp;#039;t like using Prep in duels, so i tryed to avoid it. If you have any questions, you can ask here.\n\n- All the arena fights are recorded ~1900 - 2000 rate\n\n\nAddons Used:\nArcHUD2\nArenaUnitFrames\nCCWatch\nClearFont2\nDiscordArt\nElkBuffBars\nNatur Enemycastbar\nMikScrollingBattleText\nOmniCC\n\n\n- Thanks for the interest in my movie :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df83377b0e86a6fc5c1d02dbdf46e07f045f94fe","amp;dn":"BizkiT+-+Ultimate+Assassin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df83377b0e86a6fc5c1d02dbdf46e07f045f94fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,131,55,123,14,134,166,252,92,29,2,219,223,70,224,127,4,95,148,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
