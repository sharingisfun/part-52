If Moore really believes what he says, or if it's all about the money. Fahrenhype 9/11 plunges a big needle deep into Moore's methods and answers these questions, drawing both blood and bile. See how America has been lied to about the cause of 9/11. Lied to about the truth of Islamic fascism. Lied to about how best to make America safe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb25ee5f2a7484afcd2471ff04f1d3b2cae81361","amp;dn":"Fahrenhype+9%2F11+-+VCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb25ee5f2a7484afcd2471ff04f1d3b2cae81361","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,37,238,95,42,116,132,175,205,36,113,255,4,241,211,178,202,232,19,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
