Prisoners are shackled and hooded Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfor their own protectionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢; pepper spray is used as an alternative to physical force, but in sufficient quantities to cause second-degree burns; beatings are frequent and sometimes fatal. The programme suggests that the cause is not a few Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbad applesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but a pervasive culture of dehumanisation and brutality.\n\nhttp://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/T/torture/cases.html\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cc898011d6f85bb112ffa66e4ad289da01c3df3","amp;dn":"Torture+-+Americas+Brutal+Prisons+-+Channel+4+%282005%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cc898011d6f85bb112ffa66e4ad289da01c3df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,200,152,1,29,111,133,187,17,47,250,102,228,173,40,157,160,28,61,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
