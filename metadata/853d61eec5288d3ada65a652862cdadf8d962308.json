In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide) his brother Conrad, who has gone long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, suddenly returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird and bad things start to happen to him\n\n\nResolution.......: 640x480\nVideo Bitrate.......: 48 kb/s\nFPS.......: 23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:853d61eec5288d3ada65a652862cdadf8d962308","amp;dn":"the+game+%281997%29+gasa001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"853d61eec5288d3ada65a652862cdadf8d962308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,61,97,238,197,40,141,58,218,101,166,82,134,44,218,223,141,150,35,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
