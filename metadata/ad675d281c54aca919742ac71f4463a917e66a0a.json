Immediately after entering his dormitory,\n         he comes under attack of a mysterious Shadow enemy.

You take\n         control of the main character during each day of school,\n         controlling his school efforts, managing the dorm, and\n         exploring the town, and your relationship with the community\n         affects your battle skills.

Emerge\n         victorious from a battle, and you earn new Persona Cards.\n         These cards hold your Persona summons, and by combining cards,\n         you can make a new Persona.\n\n         ps2.ign.com/objects/816/816113.html\n\n         -------------------------------------------------------------\n         +...RELEASE NOTES...+\n         ___________________________\n\n         *All voices has been fully restored to the original Japanese\n          dub; the way it&amp;#039;s meant to be played.\n         *All animation scenes fully subtitled in English for\n          non-Japanese speaking audiences.\n         *Several in-game music Remixed with alternative versions\n          (From &amp;#039;Burn My Dread -Reincarnation: Persona 3-&amp;#039; OST) to give\n          the game a different experience, including &amp;#039;Memories of You\n          ~Orchestra Ver.&amp;#039; by Yumi Kawamura.\n         *Also contains a patch to restore the original BGM for those\n          who prefer it.\n\n         -------------------------------------------------------------\n         +...GROUP NOTES...+\n         ___________________________\n\n         *We&amp;#039;re glad to present you our first release as a group, and\n          we can already tell you that it certainly won&amp;#039;t be the last!\n         *Our goal is to bring you undubs of better quality, so we&amp;#039;re\n          not as fast as some other guy, but we believe the finished\n          product is worth the extra wait.\n         *This project took a lot of our free time, so we hope that\n          you&amp;#039;ll enjoy it as much as we do.
