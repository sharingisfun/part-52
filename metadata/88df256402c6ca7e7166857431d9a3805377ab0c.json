Not much kung fu here, but what there is is gold. \n\nAvg. Rating:  3.6 / 5 (based on 4 ratings). What did you think of it?  \n\nPlot: The portly but agile Hung nimbly evades the Hong Kong police as a benevolent burglar who gives his haul to charity. An amusing martial arts comedy about a Robin Hood-like hero named &quot;FLOWER KID&quot; who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. \n \nOverview: &quot;Flower Kid&quot; was a Robin Hood-type hero who robbed the rich and gave to the poor. He was adored by many people, especially a kid named &quot;Fatso&quot;, who considered himself a kind of &quot;Flower Kid, Jr.&quot;. Madam Bee, a woman of guts and evil, hated &quot;Flower Kid&quot; because he once refused her proposal of killing her own husband. She then married a rich big shot and used his money and power to hire a bounty hunter named &quot;Skinny&quot;. Skinny caught the &quot;Fatso&quot;. But after they fought, they became good friends, and both went on to look for the real &quot;Flower Kid&quot; together... \n \nCast: Sammo Hung (Kam Bo)  ||  Wu Ma  ||  Karl Maka  ||  Dean Shek Tin  ||  Chung Faat  ||  Chan Lung  ||  Lam Ching Ying  ||  Eric Tsang Chi-Wai  ||  Hon Gwok Choi \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.836/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.836/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
