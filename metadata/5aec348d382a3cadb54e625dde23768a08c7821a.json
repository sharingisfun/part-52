Where they made their own renditions of songs by Carole King, Burt Bacharach, Suzanne Vega and many more. Composed of ten (10) covers from sixteen (16) well-known artists, these songs will surely be familiar to you.\n\nAlthough Miki's english doesn't sound perfect, her singing voice was as always, beautiful. My favorites were &quot;I Feel The Earth Move&quot;, &quot;My Cherrie Amour&quot; and &quot;Luka.&quot;\n\nIf you like smooth jazz or early swing/mellow m&amp;shy;usic, and don't mind listening to fresh renditions, then try My Fair Melodies. I enjoyed it, and hope some of you will enjoy this as well.\n\n\nGENRE:\nSwing, Smooth Jazz, Renditions\n\n\nOFFICIAL SITE:\nhttp://www.the-indigo.com\n\n\nALBUM DETAILS:\nhttp://www.the-indigo.com/picz-1008.html\n\n\nRELATED LINKS:\nhttp://www.hotexpress.co.jp/interview/theindigo5/\nhttp://www.excite.co.jp/m&amp;shy;usic/closeup/0408/indigo.dcg\nhttp://www.musicmachine.jp/interview/04/\nhttp://www.otakon.com/guests_music.asp\nhttp://www.sm.rim.or.jp/~k_yahagi/indigo/\n\n\nINDIGO's VIDEO CLIP (Live Concert):\nhttp://www.the-indigo.com/sound/050528_live.asx\n\n\nTORRENT DETAILS:\nMP3 Format\n48.6mb (12 Files)\n\n\n01.\nI FEEL THE EARTH MOVE\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY CAROLE KING \n\n02.\nFEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY DANIELS GENE MAC / EUGENE B MCDANIELS \n\n03.\nLA-LA MEANS I LOVE YOU\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY THOMAS RANDOLPH BELL / WILLIAM HART\n\n04.\nRAINY DAYS AND MONDAYS\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY ROGERS NICHOLS / PAUL HAMILTON WILLIAMS \n\n05.\nPERFECT\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY MARK NEVIN / CASCIAN EDWARD\n\n06.\nL'AMOUR EST BLEU\nm&amp;shy;usic BY ANDRE CHARLES JEAN POPP \n\n07.\nDON'T GO BREAKING MY HEART\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY HAL DAVID / BURT F BACHARACH \n\n08.\nLUKA\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY SUZANNE VEGA \n\n09.\nMY CHERIE AMOUR\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY SYLVIA ROSE MOY / HENRY COSBY \n\n10.\nLOVIN' YOU\nWORDS and m&amp;shy;usic BY MINNIE RIPERTON / RICHARD J RUDOLPH \n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THIS COLLECTION, YOU WILL LIKE THESE:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3362115\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3353848\n\n\nPLEASE READ:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------++\nBe advised that I cannot stay online all the time.\nI may be offline for some hours, so please be patient with the seeding.\n\nPlease he&amp;shy;lp me SEED once you are finished, that'll be nice.\nUpload what you've downloaded at least.
