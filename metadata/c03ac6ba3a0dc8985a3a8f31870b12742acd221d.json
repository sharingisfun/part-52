You Gotta Say Yes To Another Excess (1-11)  (1983)\n\nThe seeds of Euro-dance sown on Claro Que Si reached fruition on Yello&amp;#039;s next record, naturally titled You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess. There are fewer novelty synth tracks than before, those being replaced by a series of sleazy, deep-throated vocals on &quot;I Love You,&quot; &quot;Lost Again,&quot; &quot;Heavy Whispers,&quot; and the title track. There are also a few exercises in worldbeat synth pop, with heavy percussion on the title track as well as the closing number, &quot;Salut Mayoumba.&quot; Though Blank&amp;#039;s production doesn&amp;#039;t sound as consistently innovative as on the first two Yello records, that&amp;#039;s probably due more to other synth pop groups catching up than any comedown on his part.   AMG\n\n\n2. Stella (12-22)   (1985)\n\nYes, Stella is the album that includes Yello&amp;#039;s biggest hit, &quot;Oh Yeah.&quot; It&amp;#039;s also their best single LP, an excellent production throughout by Boris Blank, from the theatric instrumentals &quot;Stalakdrama&quot; and &quot;Ciel Ouvert&quot; to the frenetic pitched percussion on &quot;Let Me Cry.&quot; As well, Dieter Meier proves he&amp;#039;s at his best vocally, whether it&amp;#039;s the seamy side of life on &quot;Desert Inn&quot; or an exaggerated leer for &quot;Koladi-ola.&quot; Both hit their peak on the same album, and Stella is a complete joy for fans of the vocal or production side of the group.
