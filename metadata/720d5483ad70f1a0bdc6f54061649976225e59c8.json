Every day we trust our personal files to a computer. Who knows how many people will want to get access to them? If you share your computer with coworkers, children, spouse or your computer is always connected to the Internet, your private files are under threat of being revealed. Since 2001, our Hide Folders software products help our users to hide private files and folders from prying eyes.\n\n \n\nNo any way to hide a folder or a file as easy as Hide Folders XP does!\n\nWith Hide Folders XP you can easily protect any number of folders and files on your computer. You can select any file or folder to protect from the program, drag-and-drop the desired files and folders from Windows Explorer into the Hide Folders XP window or just right click mouse button on a file or folder in Explorer and select ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??Hide &amp; Lock with Hide Folders XPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? from the drop-down menu. \n\n\n\n\nFeatures and benefits\n\nUnlimited number of files and folders to protect \nDifferent protection modes: Hide folder, Lock folder, Hide &amp; Lock folder \nInstance protection - It doesn\\&amp;#039;t perform any file scrambling or moving to another \\&quot;secret\\&quot; place. \nProtected folders will be inaccessible to all users including system administrators \nPassword protection against unauthorized users \nFolders can be protected even in Safe mode \nTrue stealth mode \nWindows XP x64 compatibility \nOptional Windows Explorer integration \nEvidence elimination \nHot keys support \nDifference from internal Windows XP data protection features\n\nA lot of advanced users believe that Hide Folders XP (as well as any other third party folder protection software) is useless because Windows has integrated file and folder lock features.\n\nWell, indeed, you can lock folders with Windows XP and this folder will be inaccessible by the other (unauthorized) users. But there are some annoying limitations that you should be aware of:\n\nWindows allows you to lock files and folders on NTFS volumes only. FAT and FAT32 are not supported. Although nowadays it\\&amp;#039;s too difficult to find a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) formatted with FAT, it\\&amp;#039;s still in use in different removable storage devices. \nIt is impossible to hide folder or file with standard Windows XP facilities. Only file and folder lock is possible. \nThere is no way to make folder invisible but accessible which is helpful for different security tasks like logging, private data recording, backing up etc. \nA system administrator can easily get access to the locked folders and files. \nWindows XP home edition doesn\\&amp;#039;t have a user interface to protect files and folders. \nThere is no files and folders password protection in Windows XP (except the password you provide during Windows logon) - as soon as an authorized user authenticate himself by logging on, s/he get access to the protected files and folders. If you share your account with the another users then you can\\&amp;#039;t exploit Windows folder protection features. \n\nNew protection modes: Hide folder, Lock folder, Hide &amp; Lock folder\n\nIf you are a Hide Folders XP 1.x user, you are probably know, that all hidden folders were inaccessible as well. So if you hide a folder with Hide Folders XP 1.x you also lock this folder. In Hide Folders XP 2.x this mode is called Hide &amp; Lock. When you add a new folder to Hide Folders XP list, it will receive Hide &amp; Lock protection attribute by default. \nThere are 3 additional protection modes available in Hide Folders XP 2.x:\n\nHide folder protection mode. The protected file or folder will not be visible to a user, but it will be possible to access it if you know the path to the object. This can be helpful when you want to hide application folders but allow running the applications from these folders. E.g. you can hide Hide Folders XP application folder, so nobody will know about it, but if you type from the command prompt \\&quot;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\HFXP2\\\\hfxp.exe\\&quot;, Hide Folders XP will run.\n\nLock folder protection mode. The protected file or folder will be visible but not accessible. It is similar to built-in protection of Windows NT-based operating systems on NTFS volumes. You cannot use this protection method for Windows, System and Hide Folders XP application folders.\n\nNo protection mode. If you choose this method, your file or folder will remain unprotected even if the protection is activated.\n\nDownload Hide Folders XP absolutely FREE\n\nEasy password protection for any private folder\n\nIt is very easy to protect files and folders with a password. Just specify your own password for opening Hide Folders XP and nobody but you will access your hidden files and folders! For more security you can password protect Hide Folders XP from unauthorized uninstall.\n\nStealth mode - Hide a folder and nobody will know about it\n\nIt is possible to remove all the tracks of Hide Folders XP.\n\nWhen Hide Folders XP application is not running, hidden files and folders are invisible anyway.

Just try it - it\\&amp;#039;s free!\n\nWhen you quit Hide Folders XP, it can clear links to protected files from My Recent Documents folder, clear Recycle Bin file and folders that were protected before deletion and remove Hide Folders XP application from the mostly used programs list.\n\nMoreover it is possible to hide uninstall information about Hide Folders XP software and hide folders even in Windows Safe mode. \n\nAs flexible and advanced as you want it to be\n\nDuring the development process of the Hide Folders XP we discussed and considered every detail. Our users offered some of them, so we made the program as flexible as it was possible:\n\nYou can assign hot keys to basic Hide Folders XP actions. \nYou can change the default behavior of standard Microsoft Windows actions (Close window, minimize window). \nYou can add Hide Folders XP into Windows Explorer context menu to hide and lock a file or folder easy even when the program in not running. \nHide Folders XP is multilingual software ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? it can be easily translated into new languages. \nCommand line options allow to use Hide Folders XP from other software, scripts etc. \nSafe and reliable - Hide files and folders safely\n\nAny system and security utilities require more accurate work because such kind of software can easily make the system unstable.
