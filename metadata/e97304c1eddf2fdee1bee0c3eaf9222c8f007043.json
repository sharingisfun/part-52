Overcome with grief, her father refuses to raise her, leaving her in the care of the household servants. Dina grows up wild and unmanageable, with her only friend being the stable boy, Tomas. She summons her mother's ghost and develops a strange fascination with death as well as a passion for living. Family friend Jacob encourages Dina's father to hire Lorch, a tutor who introduces her to the cello. When Dina is old enough, she marries Jacob and moves to Reinsnes, a port he runs with his mother, Karen, and his stepsons Niels and Anders . Niels doesn't like Dina's wild ways, or the fact that she has taken over accounting duties at Reinsnes. Dina's eccentric tendencies become even stronger, eventually leading Jacob into an accident of his own and bringing Tomas back into her life.&quot;\n\n\nLinks to subtitles (not in torrent): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.com/en/search/imdbid-281924/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.com/en/search/imdbid-281924/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name: I Am Dina.avi \nFile Name (with full path): I Am Dina.avi \nFile Size (in bytes): 727,384,064 \n\n--- Container Information --- \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;): AVI(.AVI) \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;): OpenDML (AVI v2.0), \nInterleave (in ms): 80 \nPreload (in ms): 480 \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;): Aligned \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps): 0 \nBytes Missing (if any): 0 \nNumber of Audio Streams: 1 \n\n--- Video Information --- \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;): divx \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;): DivX 4 (OpenDivX) \nVideo Codec Status(e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;): Codec(s) are NOT Installed \nDuration (hh:mm:ss): 01:59:03 \nFrame Count: 178572 \nFrame Width (pixels): 640 \nFrame Height (pixels): 272 \nFrame Aspect Ratio (e.g &quot;1.3333&quot;): \nFrame Aspect Ratio (e.g. &quot;4:3&quot;): \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;SAR&quot;): \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;): 2.353 \nFrames Per Second: ***ERROR*** \nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 689 \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;): MPEG-4 \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;): \nQPel (&quot;QPel&quot; or &quot;&quot;): \nGMC (&quot;GMC&quot; or &quot;&quot;): \nH264 (&quot;H264&quot; or &quot;&quot;): \n\n--- Audio Information --- \nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;): \nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;): \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;): 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nAudio Codec Status (e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;): Codec(s) are Installed \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz): 48000 \nAudio Bitrate(kbps): 117 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;): VBR \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo): 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e97304c1eddf2fdee1bee0c3eaf9222c8f007043","amp;dn":"I+Am+Dina+%282002%29+-+Ole+Bornedal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e97304c1eddf2fdee1bee0c3eaf9222c8f007043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,115,4,193,237,223,47,222,225,190,224,195,234,249,34,44,143,0,112,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
