The mysterious and \ncharismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) is a driver \nfor one of London?s most notorious organized crime families of Eastern \nEuropean origin. The family itself is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood.\n\nHeaded by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose courtly charm as\nthe welcoming proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masks cold and brutal darkness. \n\nThe family?s fortunes are tested by Semyon?s volatile son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), who is more tightly bound to Nikolai than his own father. But Nikolai?s carefully maintained existence is jarred once he crosses paths at Christmas time with Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts), a midwife at a North London hospital. \n\nTightly plotted, efficient, and never exploitive, Eastern Promises is a compelling thriller, with powerful performances, from a highly acclaimed cast. \n\n\nCast: Naomi Watts, Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel, Armin Mueller-Stahl.\n\nVideo = (E)\nAudio = (E)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease be Kind and Seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc91fd3bcd6d240e7e8b6df3298a99c5f81c09a4","amp;dn":"Movie+Feature%3A-+Eastern+Promises+RMVB+%5BRpM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc91fd3bcd6d240e7e8b6df3298a99c5f81c09a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,145,253,59,205,109,36,14,126,139,109,243,41,138,153,197,248,28,9,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
