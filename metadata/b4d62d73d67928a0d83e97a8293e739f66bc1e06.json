The idea stayed to germinate and it didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t take long when Vesku sent couple of green fruits of songs for Alexi to revise. Alexi had been in touch with Lillman who he had played with e.g. in Sinergy. The first meeting of Vesku and Tonmi took place after midnight in AlexiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s place, when Tonmi awoke that Vesku was drawing cunts with China ink to his legs. The rehearsal of the first EP was very \\&quot;profound\\&quot;. Tonmi beated the corner of the table, Vesku sang and Alexi played acoustic guitar. The rehearsals lasted even 20 minutes. That was the only rehearsal that KylÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤hulluÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s have ever had. To the studio were went to have fun for a couple of days. Laughs, swigs and bad jokes after another.\n\nPerÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤aukko sivistyksessÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ (Asshole in Civilization) is the latest album from this Finnish humour rock act. The lyrics are like usually all in Finnish, and this time around, they sing about politics, the prime minister of Finland, a tv show called Big Brother, Paris Hilton etc. and they don\\&amp;#039;t have much positive to say about anything.\n\nAlso featuring Nightwish-keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen on keyboards Tapio Wilska singins chores.\n\no-----------------------------------------o\n|01 - Pillu.mp3                           |\n|02 - Kieli Hanurissa.mp3                 |\n|03 - Kameratutkat, suoraksi mutkat.mp3   |\n|04 - LÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤vistetyn laulu.mp3                |\n|05 - Kourallinen turhia (Big Brother).mp3|\n|06 - Heta Hyttisen taskuparkki.mp3       |\n|07 - AOR.mp3                             |\n|08 - Torakat.mp3                         |\n|09 - MÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ heitÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ sut pihalle!.mp3           |\n|10 - Tillin tallin tasapÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤!.mp3          |\n|11 - Hiltonin Pariisi.mp3                |\n|12 - KyllÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ saa Vanhastakin panettaa!.mp3 |\no-----------------------------------------o","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d62d73d67928a0d83e97a8293e739f66bc1e06","amp;dn":"Kyl%C3%83%C2%A4hullut+-+2007+-+Per%C3%83%C2%A4aukko+sivistyksess%C3%83%C2%A4+320+Kbps+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d62d73d67928a0d83e97a8293e739f66bc1e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,214,45,115,214,121,40,160,216,62,151,168,41,62,115,159,102,188,30,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
