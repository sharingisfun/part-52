After the Joker plummets to his death\n  in an attempt to kill Batman, Gotham&amp;acute;s criminals quickly escalate\n  their schemes to gain power. Batman discovers subtle links in these\n  seemingly unrelated crimes, but is forced undercover after being\n  framed for an attack on Commissioner Gordon. Hunted by the police,\n  the Dark Knight must pinpoint the unseen enemy weaving this sinister\n  web - before Gotham City falls to a fiery demise. \n\n  * A Next-Gen Superhero: Batman: Vengeance introduces the most\n    versatile 3D Batman yet, with over 500 animated movements, special\n    fighting moves and a multi-functional cape with its own A.I. \n\n  * For the first time, players can journey through a fully rendered 3D\n    Gotham City with Batman&amp;acute;s sleek weapons and devices at their\n    fingertips, including the BatGrapple, BatScope, Batarang,\n    BatLauncher, flash bombs and more \n\n  * Staggering array of gameplay modes: Exploring, Fighting, FPS\n    (Batarang, BatGrapple, Batscope, and more devices), Driving, Flying,\n    Freefall, and Puzzles \n\n  * The Gotham City environment, re-constructed in full 3D, contains 19\n    playable maps including The Rooftops, Gotham Industrial Research,\n    The Batcave, etc. \n\n  * Over 40 minutes of gripping cinematics featuring the original voice\n    cast of TV&amp;acute;s The New Batman Adventures \n\n  * Original storyline written in collaboration with Warner Brothers and\n    DC Comics, from the files of The New Batman Adventures. \n\n  * Dolby Surround 5.1 Sound featuring original music inspired by the\n    television series. \n\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &quot;MODE1/2048&quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.\n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X-\n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  /\n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    /\n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     /\n                              ___/              /        _ _\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08afc3bdf71b1b494f9b5757f5c426945e7775b0","amp;dn":"Batman+Vengeance+XBOX+-+ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08afc3bdf71b1b494f9b5757f5c426945e7775b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,175,195,189,247,27,27,73,79,155,87,87,245,196,38,148,94,119,117,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
