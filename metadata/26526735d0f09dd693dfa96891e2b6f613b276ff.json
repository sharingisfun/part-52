Designed as a strategic freighter, its range and speed were however rather poor. The first Belfast was delivered to 53 Sqn. Transport Command in Jan. 1966. Ten served with the RAF, they were all withdrawn in 1976, with four continuing to operate with the HeavyLift Cargo Airlines, operating out of London-Stanstead. HeavyLift ceased trading in September 2002. All airframes were scrapped except for G-HLFT (sold to Australian company Jan 03) and one preserved at a UK museum.\n\n** FS2002 and FS2004 only **\n\nFeatures -\n\n- 2 model set, includes RAF (&amp;#039;Spartacus&amp;#039;) and Civilian (&amp;#039;HeavyLift&amp;#039;) versions\n- High quality C-130 turboprop soundset included (20Mb in 4 downloads)\n- Reflective textures\n- Detailed &amp;#039;virtual cockpit&amp;#039; with animated throttle &amp; pitch levers and yokes\n- 4 detailed crew figures\n- Cargo hold also modelled\n- &amp;#039;Cargo Hold View&amp;#039; feature (down arrow or coolie hat back)\n- Animated cargo doors, crew entry hatch and side cargo hatch\n- Animated, working landing lights\n- Cockpit night-lighting\n- Virtual panel with hi-resolution virtual gauges\n- Fine-tuned flight characteristics\n- Authentic 2D panel with pop-ups for Nav Instruments, GPS and Throttle/Pitch levers\n\n\nType: heavy transport\nPower: 4 x 5,730-ehp R-R RTy.12 Tyne turboprops\nPerformance: max cruising speed 325 mph ; cruising 336 mph at 24,000 ft\nRange with max loads and 20% res.: 1,000 miles Range with max fuel and 20% res. 5,300 miles\nWeights: empty 127,000 lb, MTOW 230,000 lb\nSpan: 158&amp;#039; 91&quot;\nLength: 136&quot; 5&amp;#039;\nHeight: 47&amp;#039;0\nWing area: 2, 466.0 sq ft\nICAO callsign: Heavylift\nFlight No. prefix: NP / HLA ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26526735d0f09dd693dfa96891e2b6f613b276ff","amp;dn":"FS+2004+Alphasim+Short+Belfast+RAF.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26526735d0f09dd693dfa96891e2b6f613b276ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,82,103,53,208,240,157,214,147,223,169,104,145,226,182,246,19,178,118,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
