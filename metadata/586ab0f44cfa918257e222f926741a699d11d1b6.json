Additionally, we?ve updated the ?Add Contact? panel in the Cordonata skin (Cobalt to follow) to include a built-in group chooser and, when supported, the ability to specify a ?Reason? when adding a contact. Certain networks (Astra, ICQ, Yahoo) support this.\n\nThe rest of the week was spent working on infrastructure for video calls both client-side and server-side; work will continue on this front and the results are looking very nice so far! We?ll update with more information as soon as we?re able to.  Enjoy the build.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586ab0f44cfa918257e222f926741a699d11d1b6","amp;dn":"Trillian+Astra+Build+71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586ab0f44cfa918257e222f926741a699d11d1b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,106,176,244,76,250,145,130,87,226,34,249,38,116,26,105,157,17,209,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
