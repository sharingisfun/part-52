You can tell by Robert Vaughn&amp;#039;s changing hair. In this version, Thrush wants to assassinate the boy leader of a Himalayan nation. Agent Dancer was called Lancer in To Trap a Spy. Australian UNCLE agent Kitt Kittridge survives this episode, but died in The Spy With My Face. An oddity in end titles: some credits are shown over scenes of Thrushmen moving about at mansion. Other first-season end titles were shown over still frames of the episode. Luciana Paluzzi, as a sultry Thrush villainess (her scenes here are in movie version of Eps. 1), would appear shortly in the James Bond movie &quot;Thunderball.&quot;)\n\nStars: Robert Vaughn (Napoleon Solo), David McCallum (Illya Kuryakin), Leo G.
