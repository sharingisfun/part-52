This film was a pet project of Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who intended it to be GermanyÃƒÂ¢??s answer to the USAÃƒÂ¢??s The Wizard of Oz (1939).  In my opinion, UFA fell short of that mark, although not by much.  Color photography, sound, special effects, costumes and sets are all first-rate by the standards of the time.  Despite the Nazi connection to the production, the film is free of political content; hewing closely to the traditional MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nchhausen tales.  This film is not very well known, perhaps due to its Nazi connection, which is a shame.  It should be seen.\n\nADVISORY:\t\nBurn tested, but not mother approved.
