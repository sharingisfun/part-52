June 4, 2001) was an American folk, country and bluegrass composer and musician known for his mastery of the fiddle and banjo, as well as for his witty lyrics, unique vocal style, and extensive knowledge of Mississippi River lore. \n\nAs his popularity grew, he moved to the West Coast, where he became a regular on the &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;; other television appearances followed, as did recording appearances with several major country artists.\n\nHe recorded several songs for the movie &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou,&quot; winning another Grammy for his performance, and made his final tour in 2001 with the Down from the Mountain tour that grew out of that movie and its accompanying album. While performing in Texas in April that year, he found he could no longer control his hands due to a more than 20 year bout with non-Hodgkin&amp;#039;s Lymphoma and his career was finished.\n\nAlthough Hartford is considered a co-founder in the newgrass movement, he remained deeply attached to traditional music as well. His last band and last few albums reflect his love for pre-bluegrass old-time music.\n\n&quot;Aereo-Plain&quot; is John Hartford&amp;#039;s groundbreaking Bluegrass album from 1971. The music is an inspired blend of traditional bluegrass musicianship, and the hippie spirit of the &amp;#039;70s, inventivemelodies and Hartford&amp;#039;s creative lyrics. It is one of the great bluegrass albums of all-time. Shortly after being released in 1971, \n&quot;Aereo-Plain&quot; achieved cult status. \n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n 1 &quot;Turn Your Radio On&quot; (Albert E.
