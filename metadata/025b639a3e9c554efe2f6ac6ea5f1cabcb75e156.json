Zarqawi used to tell friends about\nhis sister?s dream in which he prayed to Allah and then a sword came\ndown to him from the sky. On the sword was written the word &quot;jihad&quot;.\n\nHis reputation was burnished among Islamist extremists by an\nimprobable source ? the US. In the build-up to war Washington named \nZarqawi as a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda - and a justification for\ninvasion. Since then Zarqawi has been singled out as master of the\ninsurgency. \n\nFour Corners reporter Debbie Whitmont profiles Zarqawi, and shows\nhow the power of myth-making and the Internet have made his name\nbigger than the man. She goes to his birthplace to meet his old\nfriends and confidants, interviews the experts who monitor extreme\nIslamists and their websites, and asks if Zarqawi might be\nsucceeding in his immediate goal: igniting civil war in Iraq.\n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: The Making of Zarqawi (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 399 MB (or 409,598 KB or 419,428,352 bytes)\nFrames.......: 624x352 (1.77:1) [=39:22] @ 0.202 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1111 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:025b639a3e9c554efe2f6ac6ea5f1cabcb75e156","amp;dn":"The+Making+of+Zarqawi+%282006-TVRip-d0x%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"025b639a3e9c554efe2f6ac6ea5f1cabcb75e156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,91,99,154,62,156,85,78,254,47,106,198,234,95,28,171,203,117,225,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
