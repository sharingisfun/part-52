Above him on the window sill rests a bronze statue of Matthew Flinders&amp;#039; cat, Trim. Ryan is a ten-year-old, a near street kid heading for all the usual trouble. The two meet and form an unlikely friendship. Appealing to the boy&amp;#039;s imagination by telling him the story of the circumnavigation of Australia as seen through Trim&amp;#039;s eyes, Billy is drawn deeply into Ryan&amp;#039;s life and into the Sydney underworld. Over several months the two begin the mutual process of rehabilitation. Matthew Flinders&amp;#039; Cat is a modern-day story of a city, its crime, the plight of the homeless and the politics of greed and perversion. It is also a story of the human heart, with an enchanting glimpse into our past from the viewpoint of a famous cat. Matthew Flinders&amp;#039; Cat is an extraordinary and moving novel by an internationally bestselling author.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b74e2318c72f18c9915c524f3db7baca0e0679a","amp;dn":"Bryce+Courtenay+-+Matthew+Flinder%5C%27s+Cat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b74e2318c72f18c9915c524f3db7baca0e0679a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,116,226,49,140,114,241,140,153,21,197,36,243,219,123,172,160,224,103,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
