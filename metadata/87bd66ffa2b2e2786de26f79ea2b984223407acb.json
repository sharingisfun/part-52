Although the founders of the band hail from Hanna, Alberta, a small town east of Calgary, they are now based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band&amp;#039;s name originates from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger often had to give customers in his previous job at Starbucks, and would frequently say Here&amp;#039;s your nickel back.\n\nAll the Right Reasons is the fifth studio album by the Canadian Rock band Nickelback, released on October 4, 2005. It is the first album without the original drummer Ryan Vikedal and the first to feature his replacement, Daniel Adair.
