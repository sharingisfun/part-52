Skynet, the 21st century computer waging a losing war on humans sends a second terminator back in time to destroy the leader of the human resistance while he is still a boy. His mother is the only one who knows of the existence of the Terminators, human-like robots that exist only to kill and are nearly indestructible, and Sarah, the boy&amp;#039;s mother is currently in a state mental hospital because of her &amp;#039;delusions&amp;#039;. A second protector is sent back to the past by the Human resistance to protect John Connor, their future leader, at all costs.\n[/CENTER]\n\n\n\nIMDB link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlright. Let&amp;#039;s have some Q and A:\n\nQ:  Section 8, why are your mp4 releases so large? :(\n\nA:  I can spell it out real simply. They are of very high quality. They have not been resized and shrunk to a horizontal resolution of 640 like many releases. They retain their original horizontal resolution of 720. If you compare these releases to the original DVD material I think you will be hard pressed to notice a difference. The difference is transparent to the human eye. I encode my movies to be the same quality as the original material when viewed on my 92 inch HD screen.\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Terminator 2.mp4\nDate: 25/07/2007 11:32:09\nSize: 1,781,938,744 bytes (1699.389 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 02:32:41 (9160.818333 s)\nContainer type: MP4/MOV\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCreation time: 24/07/2007 15:28:06 UTC\nModification time: 24/07/2007 15:28:06 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (mp4a) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nAudio streams: 1\n\n[ About quality ]\n\nResolution: HIGH (720 x 368)\nWidth: multiple of 16 (GOOD)\nHeight: multiple of 16 (GOOD)\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec: avc1\nResolution: 720 x 368\nFrame aspect ratio: 45:23 = 1.956521\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 45:23 = 1.956521\nFramerate: 23.976023 fps\nNumber of frames: 219640\nBitrate: 1424.376380 kbps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec: mp4a\nBitrate: 128.848089 kbps\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66aa7f34c5c1b42d38e742bdb5e3972c16cbe712","amp;dn":"Terminator+2+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharego.net%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66aa7f34c5c1b42d38e742bdb5e3972c16cbe712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,170,127,52,197,193,180,45,56,231,66,189,181,227,151,44,22,203,231,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
