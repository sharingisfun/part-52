Internet      \n        Cyclone is a proof method to change these settings easily and       \n        quickly.  If you are an experienced user, then with this Internet   \n        optimizer you can set these values manually and speed up Internet   \n        at maximum.                                                         \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n        How much speed can you gain with Internet Cyclone ?                 \n                                                                            \n        It will not make your 56k dial-up modem connection to 100k. If      \n        you have the Internet connection speed at 56k, it provides you to   \n        use it with the best performance. For example we were informed by   \n        other people that this Internet optimizer helped them to boost      \n        their high speed Internet connections up to 120kb/s (this means a   \n        boost of 400%). Microsoft publishes Windows operating systems       \n        with default settings (the most compatible settings with all        \n        systems). But you cannot get the best performance with this         \n        default values. At that moment, you need Internet Cyclone to        \n        change those values for you.                                        \n                                                                            \n        In the UNREGISTERED version of Internet Cyclone there are           \n        disabled the extra settings in Windows registry such as: SlowNet    \n        Option, SACK Option, Max DupAcks, Large Window Scaling, Maxim       \n        Connection per Server, VCache value, Combuffer value, the speed     \n        of Com ports, Maximum Sockets Value and Maximum Connection Value    \n        which will improve even more your Internet connection speed.        \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n        System Requirements:                                                \n                                                                            \n        Ã‚Â· 486DX2/66 required, Pentium class or higher recommended           \n        Ã‚Â· Microsoft(r) Windows(r) NT, 2000, 2003, XP, Me, 98, 95            \n        Ã‚Â· 16Mb of Memory or Higher                                          \n        Ã‚Â· Any connection to the net.                                        \n        Ã‚Â· 2 MB of free disk space                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n        For a full listing of Internet Cyclone&amp;#039;s Features visit:            \n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.jordysoft.com/icyclone/icyclone.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.jordysoft.com/icyclone/icyclone.php&lt;/a&gt;                      \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3aa9cce6c8c76f02c2d39a2a395bd6639dacfd5","amp;dn":"Internet.Cyclone.v1.92_CrAsH.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3aa9cce6c8c76f02c2d39a2a395bd6639dacfd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,170,156,206,108,140,118,240,44,45,57,162,163,149,189,102,57,218,207,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
