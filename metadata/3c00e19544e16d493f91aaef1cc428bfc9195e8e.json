Armed with high-octane transforming flying motorcycles, these punks are ready and willing to dog-fight some of the nastiest villains to ever hit the skies.  \nThe Sky Knight council may not recognize their official status, but that won?t keep the Storm Hawks from their dangerous quest to save the world of Atmos one terra at a time. And they?ll send anyone who dares try and clip their wings into a serious tailspin!\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c00e19544e16d493f91aaef1cc428bfc9195e8e","amp;dn":"Storm+Hawks+111+King+for+a+Day+%5Bp7%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c00e19544e16d493f91aaef1cc428bfc9195e8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,0,225,149,68,225,109,73,63,145,170,239,28,196,40,191,201,25,94,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
