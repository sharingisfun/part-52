The two documents (approximately 400 pages each!) contain a wealth of information relating to the T-6/A Texan II, it&amp;#039;s systems and operating procedures. \n\nFrom the word go, we knew we had something special planned for the Texan II and we strongly beleive that we have provided it. The Texan II product accurately resembles the real aircraft in looks and functionality and a great deal of the systems work accurately within the limitations of Microsoft&amp;#039;s Flight Simulator Software. \n\nOur main crititsim in the past has been performance related and as such, we have paid special attention to frame rates over a variety of different systems. The FSX version of the T-6/A Texan II is our first &amp;#039;Built for FSX&amp;#039; product which features, self-shadowing, normal mapping and reflective bloom. Furthermore, designing the FSX version using the FSX exporter has resulted in our ability to provide much higher levels of detail in the virtual cockpit than obtained in previous products. \n\nThe avionics are taken straight from the pages of the systems guide and as such are faithful to the real aircraft and T-6 pilots have already commented on the visual accuracy of the instruments. \n\nWhilst certain elements remain in development, please rest assured that this T-6 is a continuing product and that a number of systems packs will be released in the coming months as our technical expertise increases and we are able to provide updated items that enhance your enjoyment of the product. Our aim is to provide an aircraft which is identical to the real T-6/A Texan II in performance, systems and looks. It won&amp;#039;t be a quick process, but it WILL be a worthwhile one! \n\nI would like to take the opportunity to invite you all to viewing some of the items in our media center and on our support forums where the beta test team openly discuss issues relating to the development of the product. As always, we welcome public feedback, as it is integral to the success of this product. \n\nProduct Features \n\n- A choice of high quality 32 bit textures or medium quality DXT3 Textures for improved frame rates in high detail environments. \n- Backlit canopy gauges for accuate night-time flying.\n- Interactive Virtual Cockpit including a wide variety of custom interactive objects. \n- Appearing warning labels, prop restraints and intake covers plus more from a pre-boarding checklist. \n- Custom Soundpack designed by Christoffer Petersen from Turbine Sound Studios.\n- Custom designed simulation systems including the Trim Aid Device. \n- Enhanced flight dynamics from flight dynamics modeller Rick Piper complete with spin ability in both FS9 and FSX. \n- Two external models covering the Texan II and the Texan II NTA with external fuel tanks. \n- Authentic new 2D panel with VFR and popup windows, all with custom programmed XML gauges throughout.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b8338e69ca8b6d1f256396c093ee4b1169e639","amp;dn":"FSX+IRIS+Pro+T6A+Texan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b8338e69ca8b6d1f256396c093ee4b1169e639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,184,51,142,105,202,139,109,31,37,99,150,192,147,238,75,17,105,230,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
