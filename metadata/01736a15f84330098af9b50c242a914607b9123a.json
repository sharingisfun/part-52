Through computerised analysis it compares every aspect of the FA Cup finals of 2007 and 1957 - the year of the dramatic encounter between Manchester United and Aston Villa. The results uncover a lost era of English football via interviews with the surviving members of the 1957 final and contributors including Tom Finney and Graham Taylor.\n\nFile Name: A.Game.of.Two.Eras (Dec 13, 2007)[TVRip (WS.PDTV.XviD)].avi, File Size: 628,320,256 bytes, Video Codec Name: XviD(0047) 1.2.-127 (dev) build 2007-07-25, Duration: 59:02.440, Video Bitrate: 1285kb/s, Bits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.195, AR Error: None, Resolution: 688x384, Frames Per Second: 25.000, B-VOP: YES, QPel: NO, GMC: NO, Packed bitstream: YES, No of Audio Streams: 1, Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3, Joint Stereo LAME 3.98b5, Audio Bitrate: 121kb/s VBR 48000 Hz, Audio Channel Count: 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01736a15f84330098af9b50c242a914607b9123a","amp;dn":"A.Game.of.Two.Eras+%28Dec+13%2C+2007%29%5BTVRip+%28WS.PDTV.XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01736a15f84330098af9b50c242a914607b9123a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,115,106,21,248,67,48,9,138,249,181,12,36,42,145,70,7,185,18,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
