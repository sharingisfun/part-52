The successful standout single from FSOL&amp;#039;s Dead Cities LP got an extended remix treatment on this nine-part opus EP. It is a harder, more techno-orientated song, rare for FSOL.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;We Have Explosive (Pt. 1)&quot; (7:19)\n   2. &quot;We Have Explosive (Pt. 2) (Remixed by Leon Mar)&quot; (2:48)\n   3. &quot;We Have Explosive (Pt. 3)&quot; (5:04)\n   4. &quot;We Have Explosive (Pt. 4)&quot; (6:17)\n   5. &quot;We Have Explosive (Pt. 5)&quot; (7:53)\n   6. &quot;We Have Explosive (Oil Funk Remix)&quot; (3:36)\n   7. &quot;We Have Explosive (Mantronik Plastic Formula #1)&quot; (5:38)\n   8. &quot;We Have Explosive (Oil Dub)&quot; (6:23)\n   9. &quot;We Have Explosive (Radio Edit)&quot; (3:27)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2696c7a672ed2de3cbe654d592304ceeadd6298c","amp;dn":"Future+Sound+of+London+-+We+Have+Explosive+%28lossless%2FFLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2696c7a672ed2de3cbe654d592304ceeadd6298c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,150,199,166,114,237,45,227,203,230,84,213,146,48,76,238,173,214,41,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
