But then, we found out that all this music was \nonly composed with the most lo-fi of components - only one speaker, using a \nmicrophone purloined from a Japanese language-learning CD-ROM, being \nforced to use a single take for all the guitar and vocal elements, and, most \nincredible of all, that Grandma, aka Khonnor, is only 15, and this is his first \nwidely-released music _anywhere_. So it's just the start. And we can't wait to \nsee what happens next.\n\nThis debut EP for Monotonik, &quot;Spinach Gas Room..&quot;, is compiled from a \nselection of Grandma's most prodigous output from the last few months, and \nwe start with the echo-filled guitar improvisation and the super intricate drum \npatterns of &quot;He Near Krxern&quot;, before transitioning into the total idm \nclassiness of &quot;Sandy Point&quot;. The second half is, if anything, even better, with \nthe incredibly soulful, barely sung drift of &quot;Why The Fuck Did You Eat My \nBabies?&quot;, and the straightahead, supremely melodic intricacies of &quot;Strawberry \nRhubarb Oppai&quot;, all adding up to.. specialness. We dig. A lot.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27af4a687bf7c6d9cb203b2b3683c1603afe6bb","amp;dn":"Grandma+AKA+Khonnor+-+Spinach+Gas+Room+Spaghetti+Straps+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27af4a687bf7c6d9cb203b2b3683c1603afe6bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,122,244,166,135,191,124,109,156,178,3,178,179,104,60,22,3,175,230,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
