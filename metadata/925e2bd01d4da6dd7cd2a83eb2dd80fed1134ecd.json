The English title of the album as listed on the CD case is:  &quot;Show Your Colour&quot;.  I would have translated it as &quot;Giving you a little colour&quot; or &quot;Give You Some Colour&quot;, but then again, what do I know?\n\n\nMy opinion?  It&amp;#039;s pretty decent rock-n-roll.  Much better than most of the stuff that is popular in mainland China.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the files:\n\n-Nothing fancy:  CD -&gt; Foobar -&gt; 254kbps VBR -&gt; MP3\n\n-As usual, I didn&amp;#039;t enter the Chinese language titles for the tracks, because:\n--It would take me too long\n--Chinese characers might not exist well on your computer\n--If you like it enough, you can figure it out yourself :)\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nComments/Thanks:\n\nLike anyone else, I appreciate comments, but they aren&amp;#039;t really necessary.\n\nThe best way you can thank me is by pointing me to, or creating torrents of, \n\t1.  Language\n\t2.  Philosophy\n\t3.  History\n\t4.  Good Jam Band Music (Live and Lossless for the win!!)\n\t5.  Other Helpful Stuff\n\nSecond best way you can thank me, is by downloading and seeding.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd, of course...\n\nCuijian was a pretty key figure in bringing rock to China.  Give the guy props for that.  And, the music is pretty good too.  (IMHO)\n\nSo...\n\nIf you like it, buy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925e2bd01d4da6dd7cd2a83eb2dd80fed1134ecd","amp;dn":"%5BChinese+Language%5D%5BMusic%5D+Cuijian+-+Show+Your+Colour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925e2bd01d4da6dd7cd2a83eb2dd80fed1134ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,94,43,208,29,77,166,221,124,210,168,62,178,221,128,254,209,19,78,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
