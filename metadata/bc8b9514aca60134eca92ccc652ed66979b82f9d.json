(Dutch)\n\nFrom Last.fm:\n\nDutch martial Neo-folk. Strong associations with the fifties. Although often associated with fascism and even the nazis, there is nothing racist about their music. It has more to do with moral values in general. Musically, they are actually quite experimental. Suprising rhythms and tempo changes, very correct diction for the spoken texts and harsh and exciting drums.\n\n\nThis is their first release, from 2002.
