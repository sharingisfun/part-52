Called &quot;the truest realism in English literature&quot; and &quot;the tale of a hot, earthy wench,&quot; it meets both expectations while also offering a remarkable portrayal of an ingenious mind.\n\nMoll is born in Newgate prison to a petty thief and is soon left at the mercy of whoever will take her in. From this unfavorable beginning, the lusty, resourceful Moll loves and bargains her way from rags to riches, from prostitution in the streets of London to prosperity on a Virginia plantation. Along the way, she offers a charmingly candid view of her life and times.\n\nHis colorful characters like Robinson Crusoe earned Daniel Defoe instant popular acclaim. In Moll Flanders, he created a beautiful woman who still holds a unique place in British literature. Through Virginia Leishman&amp;#039;s sparkling narration, she steps from the pages full of exuberance and spontaneity.\n\n\nCall her the Liz Taylor of the 1700s. Forced into an orphanage following her thieving motherÃƒÂ¢??s imprisonment, Moll Flanders endures five failed marriages that take her to Ireland, across the Atlantic and back to England again. Eventually, Moll finds a mother figure in a London madam ÃƒÂ¢?? but she serves only to lead Moll back to crime. MollÃƒÂ¢??s adventures and struggles teach her that only solid determination, razor-sharp wit and unflinching stamina will preserve her hopes and dreams. Daniel DeFoeÃƒÂ¢??s classic Moll Flanders is timeless fiction that tugs at the heartstrings while bringing a smile to the readerÃƒÂ¢??s face.\n\n11 CDs.\n12.5 Hours.\nRAR.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead265df310772f81722fcc981f523c0028746ac","amp;dn":"Moll+Flanders+read+by+Virginia+Leishman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead265df310772f81722fcc981f523c0028746ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,210,101,223,49,7,114,248,23,34,252,201,129,245,35,192,2,135,70,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
