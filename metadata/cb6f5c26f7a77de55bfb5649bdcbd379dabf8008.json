I am offering it free in the hopes that it may help people. I struggled with addictions for over twenty-five years before overcoming it. This is not a commercial product, nor an upsell product, nor is it anything other than a sincere gift to anyone who may appreciate it. You are free to distribute it, but do not modify it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb6f5c26f7a77de55bfb5649bdcbd379dabf8008","amp;dn":"OvercomingAddiction.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb6f5c26f7a77de55bfb5649bdcbd379dabf8008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,111,92,38,247,167,125,229,91,251,86,73,189,203,211,121,218,191,128,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
