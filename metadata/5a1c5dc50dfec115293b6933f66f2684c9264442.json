The blockbuster success of the series is a testament to the respect they?ve shown for the comics and generations of fans. Yet, with the third installment, this superhero flick followed so many genre predecessors? third outings by going campy. In what was supposed to be the darkest chapter of our favorite webslinger?s life, Emo Spidey was cheapened by Disco Pete and Bleeding Gums Parker, to say nothing of vibrating desks, annoying news correspondents, obnoxious kids, and a slow start overall. For Bruce Campbell enthusiasts, don?t worry, his obligatory scene has been spared from cutting because, well, he?s Bruce Campbell. He offered the best levity in a movie that needed to be heavy elsewhere.I?ve tried to rework the opening so the film gets to the point faster and is clutter-free. The campier elements are gone throughout the film and some new ideas are tried so that you feel Peter?s descent as he battles the darkness within. This movie FEELS like it belongs with the other two now. \n\n\nTime needed for the edition: \n\n2 days\n\n\npersons involved: ADigitalMan\n\n\nWWW.FANEDIT.ORG\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1c5dc50dfec115293b6933f66f2684c9264442","amp;dn":"Spiderman+III%3A+The+Darkness+Within","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1c5dc50dfec115293b6933f66f2684c9264442","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,28,93,197,13,254,193,21,41,59,105,51,246,111,38,132,201,38,68,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
