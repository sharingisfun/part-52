Established acts such as dEUS, Grandaddy and Elbow rub shoulders with NME favourites Bloc Party, The Cribs and the brilliantly quirky Architecture in Helsinki. Chuck in the magic of Broken Social Scene, the raw energy of The Rakes, pop sounds of Stars and finish it off with the finest of new rave... Duels, Tilly and the Wall, Au Revoir Simone, Espers and Semifinalists and you have a compilation that will become your essential guide to what you need to be listening to in 2006...
