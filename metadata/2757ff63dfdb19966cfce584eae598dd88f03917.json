The album opens with two instrumentals, the goofy &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; by Focus that has some strangle yodeling on it and the super creepy &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; by Mike Oldfield which served as the theme for The Exorcist. The Kiki Dee Band's &quot;I've Got The Music In Me&quot; shows off Ms. Dee's impressive pipes, Blue Swede do a credible cover of The Association's &quot;Never My Love&quot;, Pure Prairie League's &quot;Amie&quot; is one of the best country-rock songs of all-time, The Sweet's &quot;Fox On The Run&quot; is a great glam-rocker, John Travolta scored a top ten hit with his easy moving &quot;Let Her In&quot;, Yvonne Elliman's pre-Saturday Night Fever &quot;Love Me&quot; is a nice surprise and Billy Ocean's first hit in America &quot;Love Really Hurts Without You&quot; doesn't really show the catchiness of 80's hits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2757ff63dfdb19966cfce584eae598dd88f03917","amp;dn":"Super+Hits+Of+The+Seventies+Vol+23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2757ff63dfdb19966cfce584eae598dd88f03917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,87,255,99,223,219,25,150,108,252,229,132,234,229,152,221,136,240,57,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
