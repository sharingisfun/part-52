The woman is beautiful \nand wants to have a better life. She suddenly  leaves her family and meets people who try to \ntrick her into prostitution, by saying she will get a movie career. Meanwhile the husband tries \nto find her with the \\&quot;help\\&quot; of a taxi driver who only wants to make money from the man. This indeed \nlooks like a basic storyline, but many people in Bangkok are very poor and these people will believe \nanything if somebody promises a less poor life. The part of the taxi driver is actually taken from a \nreal life story.\n\n The drama is filmed beautifully, completely on location. Traditionally, early Thai drama movies do \nnot show much sex or cruelties, they concentrate on the heart of the story.Those who know Thailand well \nshould see this movie anyway, others should see how life of the poor in Thailand can be and how the poor \nare abused by the rich. I find this a brilliant real-life drama.\n\n    * Spoken Language:  Thai (2.0)\n\n    * Running Time: 107mins\n\n    * Screen Aspect: Fullscreen \n\nRipped by NhatKhai, no subs, Thai audio.\n\nThis is for public trackers only, and not some private tracker that wants you to register, \nand gives leeching rights if you donate.\n\nEnjoy always.\n\nKhai\n\n[url=http://img442.imageshack.us/my.php?image=songofchaophayafronthm6.jpg][img=http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/7349/songofchaophayafronthm6.th.jpg][/url]\n[url=http://img442.imageshack.us/my.php?image=songofchaophayabackvk6.jpg][img=http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/8449/songofchaophayabackvk6.th.jpg][/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58c1566429d7dd9641af1046d545a9a2e7c85838","amp;dn":"Song+of+chaophaya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58c1566429d7dd9641af1046d545a9a2e7c85838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,193,86,100,41,215,221,150,65,175,16,70,213,69,169,162,231,200,88,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
