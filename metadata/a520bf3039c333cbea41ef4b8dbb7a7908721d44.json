Jack recalls a similar case and when they learn he is now in the area, have an immediate suspect. Jack feels sorry for him however and concludes that he can\\&amp;#039;t be the person they\\&amp;#039;re after. However, when two children are killed, both with indications of having injections, Jack may be in the soup. Supt.
