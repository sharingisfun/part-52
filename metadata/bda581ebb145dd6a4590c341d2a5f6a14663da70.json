Featureing popular german crews like BW, EI, EPSC, FÃƒâ€“NS, LF, MS, PND, TD, UDK, UZI or WP.\n\nThe Intro of SWEET DREAMS shows funny und lavish animations in psychedelic colors which reveal that the filmakers also made use of their freedom to mark the film with their personal signature. All this is accompanied by a wide musical spectrum like rock&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;roll, pop, 60&amp;#039;s rock, punk, hip hop, disco, elektronics and other electic tunes. A good hour for graff-meditation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bda581ebb145dd6a4590c341d2a5f6a14663da70","amp;dn":"Sweet+Dreams+Graffiti+Soundtrack+05+Nigel+Might","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bda581ebb145dd6a4590c341d2a5f6a14663da70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,165,129,235,177,69,221,106,69,144,195,65,210,165,246,161,70,99,218,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
