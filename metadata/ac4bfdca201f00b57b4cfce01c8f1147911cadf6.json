I prefer to shoot a moving  \ntarget&quot; - Del Tarrant                                    \nStar One is the second remix project to reach                \nmaturation on Faxi Island Records, after Second In      \nCommand in early 2007.                                  \nWe present you with ten delicious remixes of Faxi&amp;#039;s        \noriginal minimaltech/psy tune Star One. On this one      \nWe have got some returning names on Faxi Island -      \nLSDan, Fright Rate and Elmooht - and a bunch of new      \nnames to our label.                                      \nWe believe this album is truley a journey, with each    \nremix taking you to a different destination into each    \nof the artist&amp;#039;s minds. From DJ Hoax&amp;#039;s pumping UK          \ntechno vibes, through the bouncy trippy take by              \nSkyhighatrist, and the deep and dark version by          \nNoized - each remix is a new world of sound and        \ncolor.                                                    \nThe project for the original tune was posted online,          \nand artists could download the project and work there    \nown remix.                                              \nWe hope you enjoy this album!                              \nNote:                                                  \nWe really love this album and recommend it to        \neveryone who really loves Psytrance &amp; good          \nmusic.

We only want to\ngive you a preview in psytrance,\nambient and electronic music and\nin our opinion this is absolutely\nNO alternative to buying.\nMP3 isnt the same as holding a\nbought record in your hands !!\nYou need to feel the bass to go with the\nflow ... and that&amp;#039;s what mp3 just can&amp;#039;t\ngive you.
