Hailed by critics as &quot;dazzling&quot; (Rex Reed), &quot;gripping&quot; (Leonard Martin) and &quot;unforgettable&quot; (Judith Crist), it is a heart- rending examination of a critical period in our nation&amp;#039;s history and &quot;an uncompromising, extraordinarily moving film&quot; (Roger Ebert)\n\nWhen Marine Captain Bob Hyde (Bruce Dern) leaves for Vietnam, his wife Sally (Fonda) volunteers at a local hospital. There she meets Luke Martin (Voight), a former sergeant whose war injury has left him a paraplegic. Embittered with rage and filled with frustration, Luke finds new hope and confidence through his growing intimacy with Sally. The relationship transforms Sally&amp;#039;s feeling about life, love and the horrors of war. And when, wounded and disillusioned, Sally&amp;#039;s husband returns home, all three must grapple with the full impact of a brutal , distant war that has changed their lives forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc5a76e2ca300a3fae287e94cff0ac790eab613","amp;dn":"Coming+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc5a76e2ca300a3fae287e94cff0ac790eab613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,197,167,110,44,163,0,163,250,226,135,233,76,255,10,199,144,234,182,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
