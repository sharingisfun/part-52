It was inspired by the track Cruel Reality Of Nature from Buckethead&amp;#039;s album Population Override (on which Dickerson also collaborated), and was intended as a stripped down and very simplistic version of that song.\n? \tCruel Reality Of Nature off Population Override has always been one of our favorite tracks.\n\nWe decided to explore just the Telecaster and Fender Rhoades combo for some extended tracks. The CD is that, four pieces of music, very stripped down. If you liked Cruel Reality Of Nature you may enjoy this.[1]\n\t?\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n    * All songs written by Travis Dickerson and Buckethead.\n\n   1. &quot;Enter Tomorrow&quot; ? 13:07\n   2. &quot;Loss From a Distance&quot; ? 18:01\n   3. &quot;Sorrow of Discord&quot; ? 11:28\n   4. &quot;False Directions&quot; ? 8:24\n\n[edit] Credits\n\n    * Buckethead - guitars.\n    * Travis Dickerson - keyboards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17840bdc7781192b98f8ab07339495389120924b","amp;dn":"Buckethead%2F+Chicken+Noodles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17840bdc7781192b98f8ab07339495389120924b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,132,11,220,119,129,25,43,152,248,171,7,51,148,149,56,145,32,146,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
