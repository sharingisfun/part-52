The use of metaphors and abstractions will have listeners rewinding the tape again and again to grab the deeper meaning in their diction. In an industry of stunts, blunts, and 40's, GRITS proves to be a Hip Hop anomaly. If there is a theme woven through the tapestry of GRITS, it's the honest exploration of our personal nature and the need for faith in God.\n\n&quot;I really think there is a deeper aspect to the problems we go through as people,&quot; Carter explains, &quot;a spiritual aspect that goes way below the surface. We try to approach our music and lyrics with that in mind, and hopefully, through our art form, we can relay a different solution to today's issues.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26e19fa443f3487258c5da5a04286a65f330e3aa","amp;dn":"Grits+and+the+Factors-Mental+Unreleased+and+Underground+LP+Ver+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26e19fa443f3487258c5da5a04286a65f330e3aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,225,159,164,67,243,72,114,88,197,218,90,4,40,106,101,243,48,227,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
