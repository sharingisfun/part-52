We exist to serve the\nscene  with  quality  releases,  and to help the scene\nmaintain  some vestige of its former self.\n\n5000 fully working releases, and we&amp;#039;re still dedicated\nto what  we do best,  bringing u  quality keygens,  in\nstyle We&amp;#039;ve been around for over 6 years now,  and we\naren&amp;#039;t planning on leaving anytime soon.\n\nTimes have changed since we  first started doing this,\nand so have we,  but we&amp;#039;re still here.  It is however,\ntime that  the scene  itself starts  embracing some of\nthis change aswell,  instead of  dwelling on the past.\nBecause of this,  we would like to ask  all our fellow\nsceners to consider the following:\n\nSTOP FLOODING OUR SITES WITH CRAP    We have enforced\na 1-month MU  rule on our  own releases,  and we would\nlike  YOU  to follow our  lead.  Everyone is  tired of\nreleasing/testing/trading  the same releases over  and\nover again, and it&amp;#039;s up to us  to change this. There\nare plenty of uncracked, useful applications out there,\nbegging for some attention.  So stop wasting your time\non crap just because it updates a lot and it serves in\nboosting  the number of  releases your group does.  We\nknow  that we&amp;#039;ve done  similar things in the past,  as\nmost groups, but this doesnt dismiss the truth in this\nmessage, its never too late to change.\n\nIn  light of  this same issue,  we would also  like to\nencourage  everyone to  TEST  your  releases We spend\na lot of time to make sure everything we pre  WORKS,\nand so should you Remember, WE ARE the SCENE and we\nSHOULD enforce some standards on ourselves\n\nYou don&amp;#039;t agree?  Fine,  we&amp;#039;ll keep doing what we feel\nis  right anyway,  and the  end-user  can continue  to\nexpect quality over quantity from us.\n\nAs a final note,  I would like  to send out  greetings\nto all our  past and present  members for  making this\ngroup of ours what it is. I love you all\n\n-(e)-\n&quot;once you&amp;#039;ve tried it, you&amp;#039;ll never want anything else&quot;\n\nEMBRACE does this for fun, not for profit.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nD  I  S  C  L  A  I  M  E  R\n\nEMBRACE,  nor its members,  can be held  responsible\nfor anything they release.
