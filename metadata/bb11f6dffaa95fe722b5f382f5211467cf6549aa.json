Units are depicted with official NATO symbology, and US Army\n   official map control measures delineate the battlefield. Scenarios include\n   Germany, SouthWest Asia, and the US Army&amp;#039;s National Training Center.\n\n   The unique military feel of Decisive Action sets it apart from any previous\n   commercial wargame. Decisive Action&amp;#039;s ability to represent modern combat\n   and the Army&amp;#039;s planning process led to it having recently been selected by\n   the US Army Command and General Staff College as a training tool for\n   officers.\n\n   Decisive Action includes a full set of Unit, Map, and Scenario Editors that\n   allow the user to create their own battles. The simulation has numerous\n   play options such as Play Against The Computer (AI Mode), Play-By-E-Mail,\n   and Network (Internet and LAN) Play.\n\n\n   \n      Note: Do NOT unpack crack.zip until AFTER Setup.
