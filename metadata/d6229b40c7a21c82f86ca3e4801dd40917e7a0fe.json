More than 2000 Leningraders were arrested and fantastic\nefforts were made to conceal historic records of events in Leningrad\nduring the siege.\n\nStalin And The Betrayal of Leningrad features documents stored in\nStalin&amp;#039;s personal archive for 60 years. They reveal the post-war\nparanoia that led him to take the brutal steps against those who won\nthe war for him. Stalin feared they were a danger to his power and\nthat the war lessened the mass Soviet belief in his central\nleadership.\n\nStalin and Betrayal of Leningrad also tells the real story of the 900\ndays under German siege, when more than one and a quarter million\nLeningraders perished. It features interviews with the last survivors\nof the siege, documents and original film material from the period.\n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6229b40c7a21c82f86ca3e4801dd40917e7a0fe","amp;dn":"Stalin+and+The+Betrayal+of+Leningrad+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6229b40c7a21c82f86ca3e4801dd40917e7a0fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,34,155,64,199,162,28,130,248,108,163,228,128,29,212,9,23,231,160,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
