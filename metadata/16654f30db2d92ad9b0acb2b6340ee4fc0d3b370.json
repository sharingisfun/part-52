However, microsoft does not sell a standalone iSCSI server product.  Here&amp;#039;s the source of their innovation.\n\nDescription:\n\nWinTarget is a powerful software-based iSCSI Storage Area Networking (SAN) solution designed and optimized for the Windows platform. An intuitive and familiar interface enables WinTarget users to quickly install and configure a full-featured storage solution that delivers immediate benefits to any size organization.\n\n \n\nWinTarget is a software-only, hardware-independent, Microsoft-compliant solution for your storage needs. With WinTarget you can realize the benefits of Storage Area Networking that large enterprises have always valued, but were previously not cost-effective for smaller organizations. WinTarget is a cost-effective and scalable solution to your storage challenges.\n\nHere are just a few things your business can do with WinTarget:\n\n    * Consolidate Storage - Reduce Costs\n          o\n\n            Create a SAN Server for your network. Install WinTarget on a Windows 2000/2003/XP Server with internal and/or external storage capacity and provide storage for your other applications and servers. Eliminate the need to continually add storage capacity to some servers while others have unused and wasted disk capacity. Manage and allocate your storage centrally and optimize its use across your enterprise. \n    * Provide Storage on Demand\n          o\n\n            With WinTarget you can allocate storage when and where it?s needed. If your Exchange Server is running low on disk space - allocate more capacity without taking it offline to add disks. If your users are continually filling your file server?s disks ? allocate additional capacity. With WinTarget you eliminate the need to physically allocate and install disk storage ? you manage it centrally and make it available when and where it?s needed for the business. \n    * Avoid New and Expensive Specialized Investment\n          o\n\n            You need a storage solution ? there?s no getting around that. With an iSCSI-based SAN you utilize your existing Microsoft expertise and Ethernet network ? infrastructure you already have ? and technologies you already understand. With WinTarget you can implement a solution utilizing the Microsoft technologies you?ve already invested in learning, and your existing Ethernet network. With WinTarget you don?t need to invest in, learn, and support new specialized technologies that complicate your life and increase your operational costs. \n    * Increase Application Availability\n          o\n\n            Do you have systems that simply can?t be unavailable for even short periods of time? Without these systems can you process orders, communicate with your customers, or send out invoices? With a shared storage solution based on WinTarget you?ll have a solution to increase the availability of these critical systems and to minimize any downtime ? enabling you to run a 24x7 global business. \n    * Be Prepared For The Worst - Disaster Recovery\n          o\n\n            Every business is more dependent on their systems and data than ever before. Many, if not most, could not recover from a disaster that results in the loss of systems or critical business data. Statistics show that the survival rate for small and medium business that are not prepared for the worst is extremely low. With WinTarget as an integrated part of your computing environment you?ll have the capabilities you need to better protect your data and recover your systems capabilities when the unthinkable strikes. Will you be prepared ? or roll the dice and take your chances? \n      Meet Regulatory Requirements (Sarbanes-Oxley / HIPAA)\n          o\n\n            Regulatory requirements for data protection, backup, and retention apply to every business ? large or small. With a Storage Area Network based on WinTarget you?ll have the tools you need to establish, maintain and manage your data and establish regulatory compliance. \n\n\nWinTarget Advanced Edition provides the core SAN functionality required to centralize, consolidate, and manage storage centrally plus the Snapshot and Data View functionality required to implement more advanced data management and protection solutions. In subsequent releases of WinTarget, the Advanced Edition will include additional advanced functionality not available in the Standard Edition.\n\n \n\nHow important is your day-to-day data? Is backing it up once a day after everyone goes home enough ? or is the loss of even a half-day of effort costly for your business? With WinTarget?s Snapshot and Data View features you can take scheduled or on-demand snapshots of your critical data ? and if necessary retrieve it all, or individual files, from those more timely copies.\n\n    * More Information\n          o\n\n            You probably already create backups of your data each night. That data is backed-up to tape ? perhaps an incremental (things that have changed) backup each night and then weekly and monthly complete backups. This gives you a 24-hour window of protection ? at least once every 24 hours you have a copy of your critical data that you could retrieve in an emergency. It?s not a painless process ? but it?s there if you need it. Is that enough?\n\n            Is a daily picture of your data sufficient or is your environment so dynamic that a lot can be missed in a 24-hour period? Think about it ? it?s 4:00pm on a busy Friday, and you?ve just closed the books on a great month and queued-up orders to be shipped Monday morning. You go home to celebrate and at 8:30pm your main server crashes ? the disk is corrupted ? and the backups haven?t run yet. Everything you and the team have done since the previous night is gone. What does that cost your business?\n\n            With WinTarget Advanced Edition you could have scheduled snapshots of your critical data taken during the day to protect your investment ? or trigger an on-demand snapshot at the end of a critical process, like month-end close ? and know that data is protected and available to you should something go wrong. The WinTarget Snapshot and Data View features enables the extra data protection you need to minimize risk and maintain productivity.\n\nWinTarget Advanced Edition Version 2.0 delivers all of the new functionality, scalability and performance improvements of the new release ? including centralized management, support for Windows Server 2003 x64, iSCSI Boot, Microsoft iSCSI Software Initiator V2.0, and performance and scalability improvements.
