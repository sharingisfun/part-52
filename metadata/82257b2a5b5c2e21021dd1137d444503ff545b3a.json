Thirty-one years to the day before I got married.  I didn&amp;#039;t get married in Raleigh, North Carolina, though.  The sound quality is pretty amazing throughout - notch your EQ freqs around 370, boost at 1K-16K and just let it play.  A very very nice audience source.  \n\nThis bootleg was named American Accents, after a hilarious Plantation fairly early in the show, while Jimmy is taking a (water?) break after sixteen minutes of Dazed and Confused.  It features a blistering Heartbreaker (check the freaking solo) that doesn&amp;#039;t sound hurried at all, a 15-minute White Summer,  and a tremendous SIBLY where Robert improvises extra lyrics (after telling a screaming girl to &quot;have a gargle&quot; before the song,) in excellent voice.  Jimmy is especially fluid, laying down huge slabs of tonal chords in perfect synch with John Paul throughout.  And Bonzo, so often relegated to &quot;gives his usual amazing performance,&quot; does it again.  Ripping and tear-assing around the arena, the engine room operating in perfect rhythm, every click and whir in perfect synch.\n\nI don&amp;#039;t want to give away too much.  Another short show, this one cuts at 17+ minutes of Moby Dick.  An inspired performance - check out Robert on harmonica on Bring It On Home.  Well done all around, band, taper, mastering guy, and Nech, who sent it to me some time ago just &amp;#039;cause.\n\nDisc 1\n\nWe&amp;#039;re Gonna Groove(cuts in)\nDazed and Confused\nHeartbreaker\nBring It On Home\nWhite Summer\n\nDisc 2\n\nSince I&amp;#039;ve Been Lovin&amp;#039; You\nOrgan Solo\nThank You\nWhat Is And What Should Never Be\nMoby Dick (cut)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82257b2a5b5c2e21021dd1137d444503ff545b3a","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+04.07.1970+-+Raleigh%2C+NC+-+American+Accents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82257b2a5b5c2e21021dd1137d444503ff545b3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,37,123,42,91,92,46,33,2,29,209,19,125,68,69,3,255,84,91,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
