The results, need one elaborate, are exquisite! No new tunes or long-form works, just four hep cats doing some relaxed jamming on some familiar tunes: Ellington standards, except for Louis Bellson&amp;#039;s tribute to Coleman Hawkins, &quot;The Hawk Talks.&quot; Apart from his usual big band context, one gets to hear the Duke stretch out on piano--and realize what a fine, undervalued pianist he was. He could say more in one or two well-placed notes than most pianists could say in a whole chorus. The late Pass&amp;#039; playing is luminous, out of the classic Charlie Christian/Tal Farlow school of jazz guitar. Brown&amp;#039;s playing is warm as the summer sun, and Bellson is one of the consummate jazz drummers. Three thumbs up!\n\n\nDuke Ellington Quartet:\nDuke Ellington (piano)\nJoe Pass (guitar)\nRay Brown (bass)\nLouis Bellson (drums).\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles, California on January 8, 1973\n\nTrack List\n1.
