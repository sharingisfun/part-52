This movement didnÃƒÂ¢??t take place on college campuses, but in barracks and on aircraft carriers. It flourished in army stockades, navy brigs and in the dingy towns that surround military bases. It penetrated elite military colleges like West Point. And it spread throughout the battlefields of Vietnam. It was a movement no one expected, least of all those in it.  Hundreds went to prison and thousands into exile.  And by 1971 it had, in the words of one colonel, infested the entire armed services. Yet today few people know about the GI movement against the war in Vietnam.\n\nThe Vietnam War has been the subject of hundreds of films, both fiction and non-fiction, but this storyÃƒÂ¢??the story of the rebellion of thousands of American soldiers against the warÃƒÂ¢??has never been told in film.This is certainly not for lack of evidence. By the PentagonÃƒÂ¢??s own figures, 503,926 ÃƒÂ¢??incidents of desertionÃƒÂ¢?? occurred between 1966 and 1971; officers were being ÃƒÂ¢??fraggedÃƒÂ¢??(killed with fragmentation grenades by their own troops) at an alarming rate; and by 1971 entire units were refusing to go into battle in unprecedented numbers. In the course of a few short years, over 100 underground newspapers were published by soldiers around the world; local and national antiwar GI organizations were joined by thousands; thousands more demonstrated against the war at every major base in the world in 1970 and 1971, including in Vietnam itself; stockades and federal prisons were filling up with soldiers jailed for their opposition to the war and the military. \n\n\n\nYet few today know of these history-changing events.\n\n\n\nSir! No Sir! will change all that. The film does four things: 1) Brings to life the history of the GI movement through the stories of those who were part of it; 2) Reveals the explosion of defiance that the movement gave birth to with never-before-seen archival material; 3) Explores the profound impact that movement had on the military and the war itself; and 4) The feature, 90 minute version, also tells the story of how and why the GI Movement has been erased from the public memory.\n\n\n\nI was part of that movement during the 60ÃƒÂ¢??s, and have an intimate connection with it. For two years I worked as a civilian at the Oleo Strut in Killeen, TexasÃƒÂ¢??one of dozens of coffeehouses that were opened near military bases to support the efforts of antiwar soldiers. I helped organize demonstrations of over 1,000 soldiers against the war and the military; I worked with guys from small towns and urban ghettos who had joined the military and gone to Vietnam out of a deep sense of duty and now risked their lives and futures to end the war; and I helped defend them when they were jailed for their antiwar activities. My deep connection with the GI movement has given me unprecedented access to those involved, along with a tremendous amount of archival material including photographs, underground papers, local news coverage and personal 8mm footage. \n\n\n\nSir! No Sir! reveals how, thirty years later, the poem by Bertolt Brecht that became an anthem of the GI Movement still resonates:\n\nGeneral, man is very useful. \nHe can fly and he can kill.\nBut he has one defect: He can think.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13cc568e26e82a4e1d7dfd7fb4e81adfc4c55647","amp;dn":"Sir%2C+no+Sir+The+GI+revolt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13cc568e26e82a4e1d7dfd7fb4e81adfc4c55647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,204,86,142,38,232,42,78,29,125,253,127,180,232,26,223,196,197,86,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
