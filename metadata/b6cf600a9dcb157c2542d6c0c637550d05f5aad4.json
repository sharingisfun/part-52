The tale tells the stories of many characters whose lives sometimes intersect. However, all is seen through the eyes of a singular narrator: BuscapÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, a poor black youth too frail and scared to become an outlaw but also to smart to be content with underpaid, menial jobs. He grows up in a very violent environment. The odds are all against him.

His redemption is that he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s been given an artist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s point of view as a keen-eyed photographer.

Nevertheless, not only his life is attached to what happens in the story, but it is also through BuscapÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s perspective of life that one can understand the complicated layers and humanity of a world, apparently condemned to endless violence.\n\nIncludes .srt subtitles in English, Finnish, French, Spanish and Greek\n(I hope I got the Greek ones right).
