Simmers will \n  have a chance to purchase one of 70 vehicles from 10 different \n  manufactures for use in intense, pedal-to-the-metal, off-road \n  rallies. In addition to individual racing, 4x4 EVO 2 gives virtual \n  drivers the chance to join a factory race team or 4x4 club to \n  participate in an assortment of exciting missions that involve \n  exploration and adventure. These various missions will take players \n  on a rowdy ride through locations so realistic and alive that they \n  will have to watch out for animals, traffic and other animated \n  dynamic objects.  \n\n  Offroad Action  \n  Taking the term &quot;off road&quot; to the extreme, gamers can drive anywhere \n  within each of the 15 gorgeous vast areas which replicate zones from \n  painted deserts to treacherous mountaintops to tropical island \n  chains. A race course consists of checkpoints strewn along the \n  countryside. Drivers choose their own paths while negotiating \n  whatever terrain lies between Point A and Point B.  \n\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is \n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail \n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release, \n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so \n  we think a future mod will work with this release. \n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to  \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.   \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2.  \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option,  \n  choose &quot;MODE1/2048&quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM. \n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but  \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine. \n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RWs \n  and CD-RWs, so if you want to be sure that these will work \n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable \n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some \n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this. \n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X- \n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  / \n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    / \n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     / \n                              ___/              /        _ _ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704bec07d88676718c78b59a3c48c37ef8e05b6b","amp;dn":"4x4+Evolution+2+-++XBOXDVD+-+ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704bec07d88676718c78b59a3c48c37ef8e05b6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,75,236,7,216,134,118,113,140,120,181,154,60,72,195,126,248,224,91,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
