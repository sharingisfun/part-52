Moreover there were only a few painters, \nwho reflected their personal mood in their pictures as headstrong van Gogh. \nHis unrest, his problematic friendship to Gauguin, the desperation for acknowledgement. \nAll these questions are treated by vn Gogh in his open and surprisingly brilliant and \naffecting letters from Arles in the Provence to his brother Theo. \nStarting from those letters, Dominik Rimbault created a documentary over the last years of \nvan Gogh in the Provence, tells of bridges and zypresses, or light and long nights in the cafes in Arles.\n\nDescription copied fromby JumpinS.\nRipped by JumpinS.\n\n\nVideo Codec: XVID\nVideo Bitrate: 1249 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 528x720 (height x width)\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 11x15 (1:1,36)\nAudio Codec: Dolby AC3 / FAST Multimedia AG DVM &lt;0x2000&gt;\nAudio BitRate: 448 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English/German\nRunTime Per Part: 55 min 22,16 s (83054 Frames)\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 702,51 MB\nSubtitles: none","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea705793d223ca00c6c39826944ddcfd1d86e27","amp;dn":"In.the.Footsteps.of.Vincent.van.Gogh.Xvid.AC3.Dual-Audio.En.Ge..","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea705793d223ca00c6c39826944ddcfd1d86e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,167,5,121,61,34,60,160,12,108,57,130,105,68,221,207,209,216,110,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
