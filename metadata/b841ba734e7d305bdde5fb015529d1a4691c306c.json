If you like Nelson's rock, you're at the opposite side of the auditorium.\n\nAll of 44:25, it's one of those &quot;endless introductions&quot; albums -- which is, of course, perfect for interpolative &amp; background music that's not really meant to be examined closely.\n\nMost enjoyable track: 5. Listening to lizards. A little electro that predates the style by more than a decade.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b841ba734e7d305bdde5fb015529d1a4691c306c","amp;dn":"Bill+Nelson+-+Chamber+Of+Dreams+%28Music+From+The+Invisible+Exibit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b841ba734e7d305bdde5fb015529d1a4691c306c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,65,186,115,78,125,48,91,221,229,251,1,85,41,209,164,105,28,48,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
