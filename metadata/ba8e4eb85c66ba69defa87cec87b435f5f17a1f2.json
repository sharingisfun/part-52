This film shows, in graphic detail, \nexactly what happens in a small abattoir in Oldham both to the animals and the \npeople who work there. It is not a film for the squeamish.\n\nExecutives are known to have called for several cuts to be made to the footage after \nthey became nervous about the content. It is said that one of the employees has since\nbeen dismissed and that this particular abattoir is facing court proceedings for \ninfringements of the law.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8e4eb85c66ba69defa87cec87b435f5f17a1f2","amp;dn":"Slaughterhouse+-+The+Task+of+Blood+-+BBC+Documentary+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8e4eb85c66ba69defa87cec87b435f5f17a1f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,142,78,184,92,102,186,105,222,250,135,206,200,123,67,95,95,23,161,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
