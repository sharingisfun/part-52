How wonderful it is to finally see a program on television that features a gay male character in the lead(!) that isn&amp;#039;t a stereotype. In fact, he breaks all stereotypes. John Goodman plays William &quot;Butch&quot; Gamble, a tough, macho, masculine guy who also happens to be gay. He stands up for himself when verbally attacked and he likes football too. When is the last time a gay character on television or in the movies had all of those qualities?\nIMDB Plot Keywords: Homosexuality  / Gay Parent  / Homosexual  / Gay Interest\nIMDB Link: http://imdb.com/title/tt0247090/\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01 - Homecoming Queen\nS1E02 - Foreign Affairs\nS1E03 - Caught on Tape\nS1E04 - A Thanksgiving Episode\nS1E05 - Buyer&amp;#039;s Remorse\nS1E06 - Working Girl\nS1E07 - Just Another Normal Christmas\n\n[Episode Guide Included.]\n\nMore action from Operation Massive Information Leak, Wave 1.\nBloodLogic\nWhy I Fight: http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/capstate.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:415551d645ef46b277542e048b426fb291fadf0e","amp;dn":"Normal%2C+Ohio+-+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"415551d645ef46b277542e048b426fb291fadf0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,85,81,214,69,239,70,178,119,84,46,4,139,66,111,178,145,250,223,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
