Beta tests have been running and most bugs and problems are storted.\n\nThe to do-list from Project blogg #3 is almost complete. The class support is the only part not finished yet and i&amp;#039;ve added a few more things to the list of development:\n# Avoid grouped and/or elite NPCs.\n# Log off (and shut down computer) when a certain level is reached or suspicious players are following you.\n# Saved waypoint profiles.\n# Return to huntingpath if character dies.\n# Loot chests/corpses.\n# Log window.\n# Full class support.\n\nI&amp;#039;ll be prioritising the autoloot function followed by the class support.
