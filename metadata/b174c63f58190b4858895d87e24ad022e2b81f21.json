The group is widely regarded as having been a cult. Jonestown gained lasting international notoriety in 1978, when nearly its whole population died in a mass cult suicide orchestrated by Jones. &quot;Jonestown&quot; thus became a term for that incident, as well the name of settlement where it took place.\n\nIn November of 1978, United States Congressman Leo Ryan visited Jonestown to investigate alleged abuses there. On November 18, while attempting to fly out, Ryan and four others were gunned down at an airstrip by members of the Peoples Temple. That evening, Jones led his followers in their mass murder-and-suicide.\n\nOver nine hundred men, women and children perished, Jones among them.\n\nGraphic reconstructions and interviews with survivors piece together the lead-up to the biggest mass-cult suicide deaths ever seen. Docudrama, footage, interviews. Excellent video quality.\n\nFile Size: 401,233,920\n\nVideo Codec Name: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration: 47:01.480\n\nsmpjc08\nThebox.bz\nshunster\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b174c63f58190b4858895d87e24ad022e2b81f21","amp;dn":"Real+Life+%3A+Jonestown+Cult+Suicides+s01e02+%7E+2007+11+13+%5Bpdtv+%28x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b174c63f58190b4858895d87e24ad022e2b81f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,116,198,63,88,25,11,72,88,137,93,135,226,74,208,34,226,184,31,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
