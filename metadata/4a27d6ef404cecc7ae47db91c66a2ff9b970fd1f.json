I think with all the atrocities and seriousness in the music industry these days with band feuds and band civil wars there arenÃƒÂ¢??t many bands around that seem like they are in it for the fun. This is the first release/band in awhile that IÃƒÂ¢??ve come to terms with that I feel like the band is having fun with what they do and these guys in this band feel like they grew up as a kid who loved music just like any of us. I could throw out formulas and genre bull*** that probably the first thing that comes to anyoneÃƒÂ¢??s mind but who invented the rules anyway? A Day To Remember is a band much like Set Your Goals which has the furious, fast, fun, influences of modern day pop-punk and combines it with crushing breakdowns and hardcore pace screaming/chanting. For all of the music elitists out there, this is simply a nightmare. ItÃƒÂ¢??s just a known thing that a lot of people who like pop-punk and alternative rock isnÃƒÂ¢??t so much for screaming, hardcore vocals (even though times have changed) and itÃƒÂ¢??s most definite then most of the hardcore and metal core kids cant stand the ÃƒÂ¢??whiningÃƒÂ¢?? in pop-punk. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a genre clash, and itÃƒÂ¢??s an interesting mix for a band to bring to the table. Another band thatÃƒÂ¢??s hitting it off big is doing the same thing and a lot of people are in love with them, they are known as Set Your Goals. Already though if youÃƒÂ¢??re a huge Set Your Goals fan you wonÃƒÂ¢??t need to read any longer because this will be your nirvana. For those who are non-believers or just those who are ignorant to the differences in genres, open up your ears to probably the music industries next big cash in. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=16480&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=16480&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nNFO\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n            A Day To Remember - For Those Who Have Heart\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: A Day To Remember\nAlbum................: For Those Who Have Heart\nGenre................: Pop Punk / Hardcore\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2007\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / FLAC &amp; NEC ND-3500AG\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.0 20070715\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 72 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: Degos on 1/13/2008\nPosted by............: Degos on 1/13/2008\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers...............: Front \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
