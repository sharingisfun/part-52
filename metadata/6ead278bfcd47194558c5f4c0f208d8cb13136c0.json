This time, young engaged couple Pam (Teri Polo) and Greg (Ben Stiller) are getting their parents together a few months before the wedding. Greg nervously plans out every detail of the trip, only to be usurped by Pam's domineering ex-CIA-man father (Robert DeNiro). Not only has he purchased an RV, insisting they'll be driving from New York City to the Fockers' home in Miami, but he's bringing along his perfect baby grandson. When they finally arrive at the Fockers' house, Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand), turn out to be sex-addicted hippies and not at all what the Byrnes (DeNiro and Blythe Danner) had expected. With one pitfall after the next, the film takes the concept of awkward in-law experiences to new heights, leaving no stone unturned from stories about past sexual experiences to detailed discussion of current ones. What's worse, the Fockers are teaching the baby curse words weaning him on rum, to the shock of his overprotective grandparents. Every conversation is totally inappropriate and downright embarrassing, keeping audiences braced for the next disaster. Along the way, all six cast members turn in topnotch performances, with Hoffman, Streisand, and Stiller leading the charge in true Focker spirit.\n\n\nMovie Info:\n- - - - - - - -\nSUBTITLES&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;: [ ] (None)                  SOURCE&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;: [ ] DVD Retail\n               [X] English                            [ ] PRE DVD   \n               [X] Swedish                            [X] DVD5      \n               [X] Dansih                             [ ] DVD9      \n               [X] Norwegian                                           \n               [X] Finnish                 MENU&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;: [X] Untouched \n                                                      [ ] Stripped  \nREGION&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;: [X] PAL                                              \n               [ ] NTSC                                             \n               [ ] Region Free                                      \n               [ ] Macro Vision Free                                \n                                                                    \nAUDIO&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;: [ ] DD 2.0      [X] English                         \n               [ ] DD 2.0 Mono [ ] Italian                         \n               [ ] DD 2.1      [ ] German             \n               [ ] DD 5.0      [ ] French             \n               [X] DD 5.1      [ ] Other [ ]         \n               [ ] DD 6.1 DTS                        \n                                                     \nDVD EXTRAS&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;: [ ] All Included Untouched            \n               [ ] All Included Re-Encoded           \n               [ ] Partial Stripped                     \n               [X] Fully Stripped                                                                                         \n\nASPECT RATIO&amp;middot;: [X] 16:9 Anamorphic                                  \n               [ ] 16:9 Letterbox                                    \n               [ ] 16:9 Widescreen                                  \n               [ ]  4:3 Fullscreen\n\n\n\nEnjoy this release :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ead278bfcd47194558c5f4c0f208d8cb13136c0","amp;dn":"Meet+The+Fockers+%282004%29+-+PAL+-+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ead278bfcd47194558c5f4c0f208d8cb13136c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,173,39,139,252,212,113,148,85,140,95,76,15,32,141,140,177,49,54,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
