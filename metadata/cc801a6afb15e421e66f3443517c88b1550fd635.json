Ripped .: \n\nquite a few bytes, nuthing special!\n\n\n\n:. About .:\n\nFollowing the style of the TV show the game won&amp;#039;t just simply\nbe another driver/shooter. In each level you&amp;#039;ll have to maintain \nviewer ratings (VR) that acts like a timer. \nSaunter around Bay City carefully obeying the speed limit and people \nwill switch off with boredom; reproduce the over the top driving of the \ncult duo performing corner slides and ploughing through every cardboard\nbox infested alley that gets in the way and your ratings will soar.\n\nAnd we wouldn&amp;#039;t like to break up the partnership so although the game \ncan be played in standard one player mode controlling both the driving\nand the shooting both versions will allow a friend to pick up the controller \n(light gun support for PlayStation 2) and blast away while you put the pedal \nto the metal downtown. But if you are Johnny no mates then an AI Starsky \nwill pop up during the action to give you advice and generally hurl abuse at \nthe crims.\n\n* Based on the successful 1970&amp;#039;s TV show.\n* 15 square miles with over 150 miles of road of Bay City to explore.\n* Advance real-time car and environmental physics.\n* A host of vehicles to unlock and six weapons to wield against the perps.\n* Voice over from Antonio Fargas, the ultra cool Huggy Bear.\n* PlayStationÃ‚Â® 2 version will support light gun controller.\n* 18 episodes (levels) spread over three series.\n* Unlockable extras in every episode to maximise the replayability.\n\n\n\n:. screenshots .: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tothegame.com/screenshot.asp?id=209&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tothegame.com/screenshot.asp?id=209&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n:.
