The film stars Catherine Keener, David Duchovny, Julia Roberts, and Mary McCormack and was shot on digital video in under a month using the Canon XL-1s. The film blurs the line between what is real and what is fiction in its depiction of a film within a film (and possibly within another). It is in the loose structural style and narrative ambiguity of the French New Wave, and it received critical notice for this style.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290212/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290212/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2bdb4c2c3055f65b11e4f3de4ba28a5dec1f0a","amp;dn":"Full.Frontal.2002.XviD+%5BJCP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb2bdb4c2c3055f65b11e4f3de4ba28a5dec1f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,43,219,76,44,48,85,246,91,17,228,243,222,75,162,138,93,236,31,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
