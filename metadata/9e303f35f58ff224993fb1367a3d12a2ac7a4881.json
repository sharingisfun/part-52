Focusing on the efforts of five forgotten Secret Service heroes of World War II - all of whom have feathers - War of the Birds is a surprisingly suspenseful and dramatic documentary about the war taking place in the air between Nazi and Allied birds as they struggled to deliver crucial military intelligence.\n\nAlthough today pigeons are seen as vermin, their role in communicating information between the Allies in Britain and their troops and agents in occupied Europe was paramount. In cases where radio transmission and other forms of communication was not available these brave birds, which have an in-built sense of direction over vast distances and incredible flying power, saved the day.\n\nDrawing upon emotive interviews and archival footage, we hear the miraculous tales of pigeons like \\&amp;#039;White Vision\\&amp;#039;, which miraculously flew 60 miles over heavy seas against 25mph winds to save 11 crew members from certain death; \\&amp;#039;Mary of Exeter\\&amp;#039; which flew for the Allied forces for five years, getting wounded 22 times before finally being killed on duty; and \\&amp;#039;Scotch Lass\\&amp;#039; which returned to England from Holland with vital microphotographs that saved hundreds of lives.\n\nOver fifty pigeons won the Dickin Medal, the animal equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honour, after the Allies won the war. These brave birds survived enemy bullets, Nazi attack falcons and flight exhaustion to defeat Hitler and his forces and change the course of history. This documentary serves to remind a new generation of the importance of pigeons in a pre-digital and internet world.\n\n\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 1986 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 688 x 384\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:49:11\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e303f35f58ff224993fb1367a3d12a2ac7a4881","amp;dn":"War.of.the.Birds.DVB.Xvid.mp3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e303f35f58ff224993fb1367a3d12a2ac7a4881","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,48,63,53,245,143,242,36,153,63,177,54,122,61,18,162,172,122,72,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
