Pulitzer PrizeÃƒÂ¢??winning science reporter Angier sets out to bring the basics of hard science (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.) into listeners&amp;#039; everyday lives. Rather than returning to the doldrums of a high school science class, she shows listeners where and how science is happening in everything we do. Through her discussions with scientists and her use of analogies, she makes the complex accessible. Doukas delivers her performance in an energetic, soft and welcoming voice. She emphasizes and paces so as not to overload her listeners as well as to bring home Angier&amp;#039;s points. Doukas&amp;#039;s tone hints of excitement but also sympathy for those listeners who may appreciate science but who have a bit of angst for learning about it. With over 13 hours of listening, though, this audiobook is best processed in small chunks. Angier covers a lot in each chapter, but trying to grasp it all may take repeated listening.\n\nAudio\naudiobooks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:277d9c2bfeda2330ff8770544060f5fcd09a71f5","amp;dn":"Angier%2C+Natalie+--+The+Canon+-+A+Whirligig+Tour+of+the+Beautiful","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"277d9c2bfeda2330ff8770544060f5fcd09a71f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,125,156,43,254,218,35,48,255,135,112,84,64,96,245,252,208,154,113,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
