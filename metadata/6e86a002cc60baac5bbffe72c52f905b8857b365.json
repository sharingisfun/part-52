But \nwith a new identity in Paris, and the help of his lover, Mossad agent Delilah, \nhe was beginning to leave the killing business behind.\n\nAnd then he receives a message from rogue CIA operative Jim Hilger: We \nhave your friend Dox. Do as we tell you, or the former Marine sniper dies.\n\nFor a professional like Rain, the choice ought to be easy: do the job?a series \nof three hits?and save his friend and partner. But how does Rain know that \nHilger won&amp;#039;t kill Dox anyway, once the assignment is complete? How does he \nknow that each of the hits isn&amp;#039;t simultaneously a setup for Rain himself? Most \nof all, how can he control the killing rage that Hilger&amp;#039;s lethal game of extortion \nreignites inside him?\n\nFrom the deceptively tranquil beaches of Bali, to the backstreets and \nboulevards of Paris, to the urban canyons of Silicon Valley and New York and \nthe old killing fields of Vietnam, Rain must grapple with his age, with his \nenemies, and most of all, with the killer inside himself?in a battle that not \neven Rain, &quot;the stuff great characters are mode of&quot; (Entertainment Weekly), \ncan hope to survive intact.\n\n----\n\nBarry Eisler spent three years in a covert position with the CIA&amp;#039;s Directorate \nof Operations. After leaving the CIA he lived and worked in Japan, where he \nearned his black belt from the Kodokan International Judo Center. The John \nRain Novels?The Last Assassin, Killing Rain, Rain Storm, Hard Rain, and Rain \nFall?have won the Barry and Gumshoe Awards; have been translated into \nnearly twenty languages; and have been optioned for film by Barrie Osborne, \nOscar-winning producer of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
