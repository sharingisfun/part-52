It&amp;#039;s 1864, and the First Michigan Cavalry is stranded in a Virginia forest, \nchoking with smoldering fires and smoke and chilled by the distant cries \nof falling men. Among those stranded in this hell: the weary Sergeant \nLongacre (Steve Bacic, Out Of Order); Covington (Darcy Belsher, Legalise), \nan illustrator enlisted to capture the Civil War in unerring detail; and \ntrooper Jim Rabb (Ryan Merriman, Taken), who counts his brother \namong the casualties, yet still rides his beloved mare Jen with a true \nsoldier&amp;#039;s indomitable will to survive. Then one morning Jim discovers \nthat Jen has given birth and by her side is a newborn colt, shaking and \nafraid, born to chaos, and clinging to his mother for life. Longacre \norders Jim to shoot the foal, lest it prove a hindrance. but Jim-seeing \nthe colt as a consolation and a reminder of the beauty of life-refuses. \n\nAn omen of good fortune, Jen and her nursing foal join the team \nof men marching toward unknown horizons. However, the camp is \nsuddenly taken by Confederates, Jen and the colt are stolen, and \nJim spurs a horse in a long, winding chase and shoots the fleeing \nsoldier to retrieve the mother and baby. The incident has left him in \ndarkness, afraid, lost, and separated from his bivouacked brigade, \nwith a dying enemy on his hands. But honoring the Confederate \nReb&amp;#039;s last wish sparks in Jim a journey of remarkable honor and \nduty toward enlightenment and untold danger-one that will test \nthe spirit and courage of a country at war and pay heartrending \ntribute to those of God&amp;#039;s creatures who are blessedly innocent \nto the careless ways of man. \n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n?
