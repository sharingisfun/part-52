This is exactly what happened over the past few months. And with these changes you would sometimes imagine that there is a &amp;#039;Distant Calling&amp;#039; of some kind that you cannot quite put your finger on? But down the line somewhere you&amp;#039;ll have this feeling that something&amp;#039;s gonna happen... \n\n2005.
