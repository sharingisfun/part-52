Loyal and trustworthy he runs a hotel and restaurant while also taking care of more questionable matters with his fists. He is so trusted that, when Kang begins to suspect his young lover is cheating on him, the task of trailing her to find out falls to Sun Woo, with only one instruction: if she is unfaithful, she dies. But when the moment comes, he canÃƒÂ¢??t go through with it. His conscience, so long dormant, twinges and he canÃƒÂ¢??t bring himself to pull the trigger. This starts all involved on the path to destruction. Kang learns of the betrayal and attempts to have Sun taken out. Sun, for his part, responds the only way he knows how: with violence. This is a blood match now, and it will end only when one or the other dies.\n\nOnce downloads are complete please seed and leave comments for others \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2ef8224d4134626f7f4186475d5a360f645b824","amp;dn":"A+bittersweet+Life+Korean+dvdrip+AC3+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2ef8224d4134626f7f4186475d5a360f645b824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,239,130,36,212,19,70,38,247,244,24,100,117,213,163,96,246,69,184,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
