It was the place and time for Petey to fully express himself - sometimes to outrageous effect - and &quot;tell it like it is.&quot; With the support of his irrepressible and tempestuous girlfriend Vernell, the newly minted ex-con talks his way into an on-air radio gig. He forges a friendship and a partnership with fellow prison inmate Milo&amp;#039;s brother Dewey Hughes. From the first wild morning on the air, Petey relies on the more straight-laced Dewey to run interference at WOL-AM, where Dewey is the program director. At the station, Petey becomes an iconic radio personality, surpassing even the established popularity of his fellow disc jockeys, Nighthawk and Sunny Jim.\n\nVideo\n720 x 320\n\nAudio\n0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\n48000Hz  448 kb/s tot , 6 chnls (3/2 .1) \n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9734526e6994c96f90dd4c5ec74826a77129ce83","amp;dn":"Talk+to+me+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9734526e6994c96f90dd4c5ec74826a77129ce83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,52,82,110,105,148,201,111,144,221,76,94,199,72,38,167,113,41,206,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
