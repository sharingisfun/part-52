The latest version, Traktor 3, offers the a full range of features, including seamless looping, effects on decks and the master bus, mix and audio recording, 4 playback decks, full MIDI implementation, Master Tempo deck synchronization, and independent key and tempo.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nFour Playback Decks\n \nTraktor 3 deck view.\n\nThe DJ now has the ability to layer music in ways previously not possible. These decks have Sync functionality, either to a designated ÃƒÂ¢??MasterÃƒÂ¢?? deck or the Master Tempo. Decks also have independent key and tempo adjustment, giving the DJ the ability to freely change the pitch or key of a song to facilitate harmonic mixing.\n\nEach deck offers 2 views of the waveform. The top display is a close up, zoomable waveform scrolling against a fixed play marker. The lower display shows a fixed waveform of the entire song with a moving play position marker. Clicking with the mouse in either display will start playback at that position. Also in the display are the tempo, automatic gain control value, file bitrate, beats elapsed, time elapsed, time remaining, and phase (which in Traktor indicates the deviation between the song in that deck and the master).\n\n\n[edit]\nEffects and EQ\n \nFull mixer section with effects and EQ..\n\nEach playback deck has an assignable effects processor, as does the master output channel, giving the DJ a maximum of 2 effects layers. Each effects processor has the following effects optionsÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦\n\nFilter T2 ÃƒÂ¢?? This is the classic filter section from previous versions of Traktor.\nFilter 92 ÃƒÂ¢?? This filter is an emulation of the Allen &amp; Heath Xone92 filter section.\nDelay ÃƒÂ¢?? Delay with tap tempo.\nReverb ÃƒÂ¢?? Standard reverb with Tone adjustment.\nFlanger ÃƒÂ¢?? A common Flange effect\nBeatMasher ÃƒÂ¢?? Allows for hyper edits of the song ala Aphex Twin or Squarepusher.\n\nThe EQ section offers several modes of operation, including emulation modes for the popular Pioneer DJM-600, Ecler Nuo4, and Allen &amp; Heath Xone92 mixers.\n\n\n[edit]\nLooping, Beat Jumping, and Deck Caching\n \nLooping widgets.\n\nTraktor 3 has extensive support for looping. Loop lengths are selected by the DJ and are musically logical in length (from 1/8th of a measure to 32 measures). Start and end points are quantized based on the BPM of the song. Once a loop is set, that loop can be moved using the Loop Move buttons, again in musically logical values. If the DJ desires, loop start and end points can be set manually to non musical values.\n\nBeat jumps work in much the same way as looping does, allowing the play position to be moved forward or backward within the song at a value determined by the DJ.\n\nBoth looping and beat jumping features benefit from the new deck caching functionality introduced in Traktor 3. In previous versions of Traktor, moving a loop or beat jumping would introduce a small pause in the audio. As its name implies, deck caching allows the user to determine how much RAM is assigned to each set of decks, and songs loaded into those decks are cached into that RAM for instant access by Traktor. This, combined with the ÃƒÂ¢??Snap to BeatÃƒÂ¢?? functionality, allows a user to move seamlessly within a song and opens up more possibilities for on the fly remixing. And like most of the features in Traktor, the looping and beat jumping functions can be mapped to a MIDI controller.\n\n\n[edit]\nFile Browser\n\nTraktorÃƒÂ¢??s file browser is simliar to that of iTunes. It lists audio files by row, with columns available to describe various track properties, including comments, tags, and ratings. Information from each songÃƒÂ¢??s ID3 tag is parsed by Traktor and made available in the browser, and can be edited from within the program. All information that cannot be written to ID3 tags (such as comments for a wav file) is stored in a single proprietary database file.\n\n\n[edit]\nTraktor in the WildÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦\n\nTraktor is being bundled with many of the newer MIDI devices recently released, including the Allen &amp; Heath Xone 3D, Behringer BCD3000, Numark Total Control, and the Vestax VCI-100. MIDI templates for Traktor are also bundled with the Feena Electronics FMDJ9303, the KontrolDJ, and the Ecler Nuo series of mixers. But a dedicated controller isnÃƒÂ¢??t necessary because any MIDI device can be used to control TraktorÃƒÂ¢??s features. Likewise, Traktor is compatible with a wide variety of audio interfaces on both Mac and PC.\n\n[edit]\nExternal links","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ff03abc75d26aab9cd3ed504ce403e3d5b2da7","amp;dn":"TraktorDJStudio3.app","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68ff03abc75d26aab9cd3ed504ce403e3d5b2da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,255,3,171,199,93,38,170,185,205,62,213,4,206,64,62,61,91,45,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
