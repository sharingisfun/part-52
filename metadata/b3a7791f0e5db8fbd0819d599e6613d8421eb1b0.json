It&amp;#039;s not very good but that&amp;#039;s kinda my thing. I play mostly acoustic, with a few techno type songs on my second album. This collection contains my first 2 CDs, a comp that I&amp;#039;m on, and an extra song I recorded for the same people who put me on the comp. It&amp;#039;s a mixture of nerdy and comedy music, my influences come from folk, punk, ska, and other assorted genres. I don&amp;#039;t ask for any money, not even donations, this is completely free music. You might like it, you might not but it&amp;#039;s free so why not give it a listen? If you&amp;#039;re interested check out my myspace page: http://myspace.com/anarchyshoe\n\nThanks and Enjoy!\n-Sheep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3a7791f0e5db8fbd0819d599e6613d8421eb1b0","amp;dn":"Sheep+and+Other+Anomalies+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3a7791f0e5db8fbd0819d599e6613d8421eb1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,167,121,31,14,93,184,251,208,129,157,89,158,102,19,216,66,30,177,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
