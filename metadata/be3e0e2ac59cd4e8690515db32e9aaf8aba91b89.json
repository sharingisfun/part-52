When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy&amp;#039;s passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3e0e2ac59cd4e8690515db32e9aaf8aba91b89","amp;dn":"RATATOUILLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3e0e2ac59cd4e8690515db32e9aaf8aba91b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,62,14,42,197,156,212,232,105,5,21,219,50,233,170,248,171,169,27,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
