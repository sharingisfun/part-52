Lollopolooza footage 1991 -\n\t\tThanks to Slaytez for this. \n\t\tDifferent footage to what appears on the Closure leak, features Head like a hole (with Ice T on guitar) and a brief interview with TR. \n\t\t10 minutes\n\n\t2. Previously uncirculated shoot of the 7/11/05 - Manchester, UK show -\n\t\tThis has been spoken of before in the bootleg thread of the Tour News section in 2005, and i remember a few UK fans being anxious to get it... \n\t\tApparently it has never been released, until now. \n\t\tNicely shot from the pit, some obstructions, very nice sound. \n\t\tOnly source of this show available, supposedly. \n\t\tReleased with the full permission of the filmer.\n\t\t75 minutes. (Incomplete)\n\n\t3. TR performing 'Suck' with Pigface -\n\t\tBest quality version i've ever seen, as requested.\n\n\t4. Previously uncirculated DV cam footage from the Melbourne 2005 Rod Laver Arena soundcheck. -\n\t\tSound isn't great but definetly worth having, especially if you were there. \n\t\tShot from up in the back somewhere\n\t\t*NOTE: I DID NOT SHOOT THIS, SO PLEASE DON'T ASK FOR MASTER DV CLONES!*\n\t\tYou can see me and my better half down in front of the stage, so it would've been a bit hard for me to shoot it, eh? \n\t\tHow it was shot, i do not know. \n\t\tThis was sent to me unsolicited from a Mt Eliza address about 15 months ago. \n\t\tI still don't know who sent this to me, apparently i posted my old p.o box address somewhere on the forum and one day this popped up in it. \n\t\tThe writing on the address form and the accompanying letter looks very feminine, so i'm presuming a female fan sent this. \n\t\tWhoever you are, obviously you lurk or are registered on this forum, so thank you very much. \n\t\tIf you'd like to contact me i will promise not to reveal you as the sender. \n\t\tI'd like to thank Matt, Dave and Devon who have had this footage for awhile now and upheld their promises not to share it without asking. \n\t\tCheers dudes.\n\t\t15 minutes \n\n\t5. Extras -\n\t\tA few highlights from the 2005 tour DVD boots, including the &quot;Something's gonna get BROKEN!&quot; Philly HLAH and Reptile performances and the stage invader during Suck in Argentina. \n&quot;\n\nThanks to the usual people.
