The specter of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), \nwho has been elevated to another plane of existence in death, appears in \nOÃƒÂ¢??NeillÃƒÂ¢??s prison cell and offers the mystical wisdom of Oma. Since SG-1 lacks \nthe firepower to attack BaÃƒÂ¢??alÃƒÂ¢??s fortress, TealÃƒÂ¢??c (Christopher Judge) suggests \nrecruiting one of the other system lords to attack it. OÃƒÂ¢??Neill and the slave \nescape together as Daniel appears one last time to tell him ÃƒÂ¢??YouÃƒÂ¢??re going to \ne all right.ÃƒÂ¢??\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEpisode 07 - Shadowplay\n\nOriginal air date: July 26, 2002 \nSG-1 receives a delegation from Kelowna, a country on Jonas&amp;#039; home planet. The \nleader of the delegation tells SG-1 that peace on his planet is being threatened \nby a non-aggression pact between two rival powers. The Kelownans offer to trade \nnaquadria for some of Earth&amp;#039;s superior military technology. Without it, the \nKelownans say they will be forced to unleash the awesome destructive power of \ntheir newly developed naquadria bomb. Dr. Kieran, a Kelownan scientist who worked \non the bomb, tells Jonas he&amp;#039;s part of a resistance movement bent on saving the \nplanet from destruction. Jonas tell Hammond a coup is afoot and the Pentagon sends \nSG-1 to negotiate with the Kelownan government. It&amp;#039;s an emotional homecoming for \nJonas, who is still seen as a traitor by some of his countrymen. While Dr. \nKieran arranges a meeting between SG-1 and the leaders of the resistance, \nKelownan First Minister Valis tells Jonas that Kieran has been acting strangely\n and asks him to spy on the doctor. On the way back to resistance headquarters, \nKelownan guards open fire on Jonas and Kieran chasing them into a warehouse. Jonas \ndrives them off with cover fire, but Kieran falls off a catwalk and is knocked \nunconscious. The Kelownans deny attacking Kieran as a rebel spy. Carter uses a \nspecial device to track Kieran&amp;#039;s smuggled naquadria to resistance headquarters. \nThey find naquadria, but the building is otherwise deserted. Brain scans reveal \nthat Kieran is suffering from advanced schizophrenia caused by prolonged exposure \nto naquadria. The team realizes that the resistance was a fantasy that existed \nonly created in Kieran&amp;#039;s deteriorating mind. The Kelownan bomb project turns \nout to be flawed technology and SG-1 returns home with a large quantity of \nnaquadria, leaving Jonas&amp;#039; troubled homeland to fight its battles alone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEpisode 08 - The Other Guy\n\nOriginal air date: August 2, 2002 \nProfessors Coombs, Meyers and Felger are examining the ruins of a gou&amp;#039;ald temple \non an unfriendly planet. O&amp;#039;Neill and Teal&amp;#039;c, who are standing guard, leave to \njoin Carter and Jonas, who are a short distance testing equipment near the \nstargate. Gou&amp;#039;ald attack vessels suddenly swoop down and capture the team, but \ninstead of following O&amp;#039;Neill&amp;#039;s orders and heading back to stargate command, Felger \ndecides to go after them. Meyers heads back to SGC and tells Hammond that \nFelger and Coombs have used the rings at the ruins to go up to the orbiting \ngou&amp;#039;ald mothership where SG-1 is being held captive. Felger and Coombs crawl \nthrough some ducts and find SG-1&amp;#039;s holding cell. O&amp;#039;Neill is furious with them \nfor disobeying orders. Carter reveals that their capture was faked to facilitate \na meeting with Khonsu, a high-ranking gou&amp;#039;ald who is actually an undercover \nTok&amp;#039;ra. Felger and Coombs take cover behind some piled-up containers, but realize \nsomething is amiss when two jaffa are gunned down nearby. Her&amp;#039;ak, who is supposed \nto deliver SG-1, instead pens them inside a force field and sets off to kill \nKhonsu. Felger and Coombs travel to Khonsu&amp;#039;s planet, sneak inside the pyramid \nand witness the killing. The two wayward scientists access the pyramid control \nroom and contact the team on a gou&amp;#039;ald PA system. With Carter&amp;#039;s help, they \nunlock a stash of weapons. Felger delivers the guns, while Coombs works on \nshutting off the force field. SG-1 and Felger escape and attack the jaffa \nwho are guarding the stargate, but Coombs gets trapped inside the control \nroom, forcing Teal&amp;#039;c and O&amp;#039;Neill to ring back inside and rescue him. Back \nat SGC, Felger and Coombs receive special medals of honour for their bravery.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f457be46c8b24440877f49e88b4561ab4cbc52a","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG-1+Season+6+Disc+2.StarFans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f457be46c8b24440877f49e88b4561ab4cbc52a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,69,123,228,108,139,36,68,8,119,244,158,136,180,86,26,180,203,197,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
