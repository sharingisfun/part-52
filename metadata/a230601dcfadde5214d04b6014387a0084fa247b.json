He and his team of medical doctors try to cure very ill ordinary people in the United States of America.\n\n\n--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHouse&amp;#039;s ex-girlfriend Stacy Warner returns-not for House but to get help for her ailing husband, Mark. While House decides whether or not to take her case, Cuddy forces him to present a lecture to a class of medical students. As he weaves the stories of three patients who all present with a similar symptom, House gives a lecture the students will never forget - he discusses three past cases, one of which is more than meets the eye.\n\n--- Info ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\naudio codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3, 48000Hz  155 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo LAME3.92\n\ncideo codec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 1\n\nresolution: 624 x 352 pix\n\nsize: 343 MB (or 351,952 KB or 360,398,848 bytes)\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0606046/\n\nOriginal air date: 17 May 2005 (Season 1, Episode 21)\n\n\n--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, I didn&amp;#039;t make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. \nBut like a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or \nrarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. \nSo I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.\n\nThere will probably be more....\n\n__Razer__\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a230601dcfadde5214d04b6014387a0084fa247b","amp;dn":"House+MD+-+121+-+Three+Stories.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a230601dcfadde5214d04b6014387a0084fa247b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,48,96,29,207,173,222,82,20,208,75,96,20,56,122,0,132,250,36,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
