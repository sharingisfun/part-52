No learning curve required, just pick up and \n  play!  The most spectacular crashes ever - period. Burnout's action will\n  leave you sweating, short of breath and totally in shock. \n  \n  Hyperventilating is part of the fun.  Burnout monitors your driver's\n  heart rate: you're rewarded for near-misses and the more risks you\n  take. Civilians steer clear!\n\n\n  * There's only one way to drive in Burnout: DANGEROUSLY. Force traffic\n    into your opponent's path and risk a head-on collision to secure a\n    win!\n\n  * Slide, cut close and drive into oncoming traffic and you'll be\n    rewarded for your risk-taking.\n\n  * Crashes are based on actual crash and damage physics for the ultimate\n    in stunning realism.\n\n  * Instant replays allow you to relive your handiwork from multiple\n    angles, in all of its cringe-inducing, metal bashing glory.\n\n  * Incredibly advanced traffic AI: civilians try to avoid and warn you\n    while opponents try to slam you off the road!\n\n  * Cruise the United States and Europe on 14 awsome, traffic-filled \n    courses, through cities and into the countryside.\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &quot;MODE1/2048&quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.\n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X-\n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  /\n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    /\n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     /\n                              ___/              /        _ _\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7ffbc5afbfda9b2669d88c92e89d4de10914d93","amp;dn":"Burnout+XBOX+-+ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7ffbc5afbfda9b2669d88c92e89d4de10914d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,255,188,90,251,253,169,178,102,157,136,201,46,137,212,222,16,145,77,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
