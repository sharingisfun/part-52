When a Predator scout ship crash-lands in the hills outside the town, Alien facehuggers are released in the crash, and an even more evil creature - a hybrid Alien/Predator - is also released. A man &amp; his son hunting in the forests near the crash site soon become the first victims of the facehuggers, and when a Predator receives data about the crash on his home planet, he comes to Earth. One at a time, the inhabitants of the town become targets of the Aliens and the Predator, including the local sheriff, a young female soldier recently returned from Iraq, and several teens. Though the National Guard is called in, they are unable to stop the deadly creatures, and a plan is set in motion to destroy the town with a nuclear device.\n\n\n\n\n\nmay need dvix player, does play with vcl player.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858a031b79ade7254137f817c57d01b4e78afccb","amp;dn":"Alien+vs+Predator+requim+dvd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858a031b79ade7254137f817c57d01b4e78afccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,138,3,27,121,173,231,37,65,55,248,23,197,125,1,180,231,138,252,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
