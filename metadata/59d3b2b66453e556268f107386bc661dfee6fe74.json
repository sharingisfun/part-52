Captured using MPEG-2 (NTSC, 720 X 480, 60 Hz, 4:3) and AC3 compression.\n\n The audio is mostly in English with a little Japanese commentary and text.\n\n That's two great games in a row!\n \n What more could we ask for?\n \n As the folks in Michigan know well enough, making dire predictions about a Detroit demise is like pouring high-octane fuel over their pistons.  \n \n On a side note, I didn't know Horry was capable of throwing up 3-point bricks in crunch time; and I sure as heck wanna know if Duncan is ever gonna stop choking down the stretch. \n \n If you got the empty space on your hardisk and a bit of patience to download, enjoy. And hope to see you again for game 7.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d3b2b66453e556268f107386bc661dfee6fe74","amp;dn":"2005+NBA+FINALS+SPURS+PISTONS+GAME+6+%28JUNE+21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d3b2b66453e556268f107386bc661dfee6fe74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,211,178,182,100,83,229,86,38,143,16,115,134,188,102,29,254,230,254,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
