The Saxon Stories ÃƒÂ¢?? is set in 9th century England and focuses on the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex during the reign of Alfred the Great, and deals with his opposition to the Danes (Vikings), becoming as a result the only English monarch to be awarded the epithet &quot;the Great&quot; by his people. According to Cornwell&amp;#039;s replies on his website bulletin board, the series will not be a trilogy like his other medieval works, but will have 3 or 4 more sequels: &quot;I&amp;#039;m not sure how many there will be - perhaps seven? maybe eight?&quot;[5]\n\n   1. The Last Kingdom (2004)\n   2. The Pale Horseman (2005)\n   3. The Lords of the North (2006)\n   4. Sword Song (2007)\n   5. The Archer&amp;#039;s Tale (2008)\n\n\n\nThe Grail Quest novels\n\n    \n\nThis trilogy deals with a mid-14th century search for the Holy Grail, around the time of the Hundred Years&amp;#039; War. Cornwell was planning at one point writing more books about the main character Thomas of Hookton and said that shortly after finishing Heretic he said &quot;...have started another Thomas of Hookton book, then stopped it - mainly because I felt that his story ended in Heretic and I was just trying to get too much from him. Which doesn&amp;#039;t mean I won&amp;#039;t pick the idea up again sometime in the future.&quot; [4]\n\n   1. Harlequin (re-named The Archer&amp;#039;s Tale for the USA) (2000) ÃƒÂ¢??

After he left them he changed his name to his mother&amp;#039;s maiden name, Cornwell.\n\nCornwell was born in London in 1944. His father was a Canadian airman. His mother was English, a member of the Women&amp;#039;s Auxiliary Air Force. He was adopted and brought up in Essex by the Wiggins family, who were members of the Peculiar People, a strict Protestant sect who banned frivolity of all kinds and even medicine. Cornwell was sent away to Monkton Combe School, attended the University of London, and after graduating, worked as a teacher. He then joined BBC&amp;#039;s Nationwide and was promoted to become head of current affairs at BBC Northern Ireland. He then joined Thames Television as editor of Thames News.[1]\n\nHe married an American, Judy, in 1980 and relocated to the U.S.. Unable to get a Green Card, he started writing novels, as this did not require a work permit.\n\nIn June 2006, Cornwell was awarded an OBE (Officer, Order of the British Empire) in the Queen&amp;#039;s 80th Birthday Honours List.\n\n\n\n\nhttpwww.bernardcornwell.net\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Cornwell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Cornwell&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSeed this man ! \n\nIf you take it check back now and then to make sure its seeded well. \n\nHelp Keep it alive.\n\n\nSeed The torrent, you got it for nothing and pay every month for your \n\nInternet connection.
