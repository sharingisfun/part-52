His role in the film, like Winston Wolfe\\&amp;#039;s, is described as that of a \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; -- one who covers up assassinations, accidents, and other messy situations.\n\nCD1          : 50x15mb\nFile size    : 716 MiB\nPlayTime     : 1:27:41\nBit rate     : 1142 Kbps\nBit rate     : 916 Kbps\nWidth        : 640 pixels\nHeight       : 272 pixels\nAspect ratio : 2.35\nFrame rate   : 23.976 fps\nLanguage     : English\nCodec        : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nBit rate     : 126 Kbps\nBit rate mode: VBR\nChannel(s)   : 2 channels\nSampling rate: 44 KHz\n\nSAMPLE ADDED 1 MIN IN LENGTH\nEncoders notes:\nNOT ONE OF MY BEST \nrespects to \\&quot;unknown\\&quot; for the release \ni aimed to gain more color and less brightness into the release, hope you enjoy it as this is me going back to my roots with taking on each section \nof a film from dark and light parts of the film , also now doing the releases in 23.976fps, so thanks to those giving their CONTSRUCTIVE comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65903971a42bd25550df14ca836df92a02c9ab58","amp;dn":"Alien.vs.Predator.Requiem.2007.CAM.Xvid-Dragon25","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65903971a42bd25550df14ca836df92a02c9ab58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,144,57,113,164,43,210,85,80,223,20,202,131,109,249,42,2,201,171,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
