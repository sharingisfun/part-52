(i.e. readers of Moore?s blog and Starbucks customers) to propose which changes the company must make to maintain (reclaim?) its integrity.\n\nAbout the author:\nFor the past decade, John Moore has made his mark in the marketing world by creating, championing, and implementing marketing ideas and branding ideals for Whole Foods Market and Starbucks Coffee. As the Director of National Marketing for Whole Foods Market, John focused his team on engaging in activities which were less about using traditional advertising and more about using the influential power of customers as the advertising vehicle. At Starbucks, John led countless highly successful in-store and out-of-store marketing promotions as a Retail Marketing Manager. Today, through speaking engagements and through his Brand Autopsy Marketing Practice, John shares business and marketing advice with companies aspiring to become the next Whole Foods or Starbucks. He has been recognized by Fast Company magazine as a ?leading practitioner of the arts of customer service and marketing? and serves as a Standards Council Advisory Board Member with the Word of Mouth Marketing Association. John is also the author of the Brand Autopsy blog and the author of Tribal Knowledge, a business management book from Kaplan Publishing (fall 2006).\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18108ec6d6ec5a94f286972f7dbc805f726d4a3","amp;dn":"What+Must+Starbucks+Do+%28PDF%29%28Manifesto%29+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18108ec6d6ec5a94f286972f7dbc805f726d4a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,129,8,236,109,110,197,169,79,40,105,114,247,219,200,5,247,38,212,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
