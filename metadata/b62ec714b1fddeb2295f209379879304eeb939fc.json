It compiles the live performances from 1 NovemberÃƒÂ¢??5 November 2005 at the Manchester Opera House that recreated the Demon Days Studio album and was directed by David Barnard and Grant Gee.\n\nNearly all of the album&amp;#039;s performers were available to participate in the event, including Neneh Cherry, Bootie Brown, Shaun Ryder and Ike Turner. MF DOOM and Dennis Hopper appeared through video and narration, respectively. Local Manchester choirs were hired for the performances.\n\nIncluded as an encore are &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, a song written for the War Child album Help: a Day in the Life, and &quot;Latin Simone (Que Pasa Contigo)&quot; from the Gorillaz album, as a tribute to the memory of Ibrahim Ferrer, who died before the event took place. Also included are the visuals seen on the large screen for all but three of the performances, as those songs featured single cover art for the duration of each respective song. The visuals for &quot;Kids With Guns&quot; are the contribution by the &quot;Search For A Star&quot; Video winner &quot;Carlos&quot;.\n\n\nTrack listing\n1. &quot;Intro&quot; (Gorillaz, D.
