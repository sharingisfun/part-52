Well known for their stunning live performances and amazing atmospheric grooves.  Angler&amp;#039;s music is a combination of electronic / loose beats / twangy guitar riffs.  In search of charm is the album that started it all for the four piece band, not sure when it was released, I think it may have been 1998 or 1999.  The following albums were good, but this one is my personal favorite.\n\n-RS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e9e3faa36084a427ebc85464f3d37665e3b817","amp;dn":"Angler+-+In+Search+of+Charm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0e9e3faa36084a427ebc85464f3d37665e3b817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,233,227,250,163,96,132,164,39,235,200,84,100,243,211,118,101,227,184,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
