A radio simulcast of the musical portion was broadcast on sister station WPIX-FM (now WQCD) until 1988.\n\nThe program, which has run anywhere from two to twenty four hours in length, but as of 2007 is officially listed as three hours, has no story and no TV commercial interruptions. It is simply a film loop of a Yule log burning in a fireplace, with a traditional soundtrack of classic Christmas carols and secular music playing in the background.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_Log_(TV_program)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_Log_(TV_program)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt&amp;#039;s about 20 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:045af63e0dc828fb959cbe4755d9a1a734f52134","amp;dn":"Warming+Winter+Fireplace+Video+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"045af63e0dc828fb959cbe4755d9a1a734f52134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,90,246,62,13,200,40,251,149,156,190,71,85,217,161,167,52,245,33,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
