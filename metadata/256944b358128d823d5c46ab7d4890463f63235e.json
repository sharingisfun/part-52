The 15 tracks (including an alternative version of a Pandamonium live favourite, 'My Old Flame') range from their spirited cover of Donovan's classic 'Season Of The Witch' (the band's version of which actually appeared before Donovan's) to the most popular of their CBS singles, 'No Presents For Me'. Although the musical styles vary with pleasing regularity, the quality of Ponton and Curtis's song writing is, as usual, consistent throughout. This collection of singles and rarities brings as up to the time the duo signed with Liberty and their only official album ever to see the light of day, Thoughts And Words, which the boys recorded with exWomble Mike Batt.&quot;\n\n Song Title\n1.Season Of The Witch\n2.Today I'm Happy\n3.No Presents For Me\n4.Sun Shines From His Eyes\n5.Chocolate Buster Dan\n6.Fly With Me Forever\n7.My Old Flame\n8.Hermit\n9.It's Alright Baby\n10.Latin Way\n11.All I Want Is You\n12.Discrimination\n13.What A Funny World\n14.Simple Man\n15.My Old Flame (Alternative Version)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256944b358128d823d5c46ab7d4890463f63235e","amp;dn":"The+Pandamonium-No+Presents+For+Me...Singles+%26+Rarities%281966-72%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256944b358128d823d5c46ab7d4890463f63235e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,105,68,179,88,18,141,130,61,92,70,171,125,72,144,70,63,99,35,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
