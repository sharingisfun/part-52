When they read the captain&amp;#039;s log and hear the tapes made in the control room, Nelson and Crane are puzzled: Captain Williams went insane and machine-gunned officer Richardson, yet both men were close friends. It seems that after they had left a mysterious island, the men became deadly enemies.\n\nNelson and Crane investigate the island and are captured by a General of The People&amp;#039;s Republic. Taken to separate cells, Crane is made to resent Nelson and they are turned loose, leaving Crane free to eat drug soaked berries. Crane loses control and screams that he&amp;#039;s going to kill Nelson! \n\nWriter:  William Read Woodfield  \n \nDirector:  Felix Fiest  \n \nStar:  Terry Becker (CPO Francis E.
