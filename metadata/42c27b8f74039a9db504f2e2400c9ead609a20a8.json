Nicky\n                      (Sandler) is relieved when his father (Harvey Keitel)\n                      decides to continue as ruler of the underworld for\n                      another 10,000 years instead of picking one of his\n                      bullying brothers, Adrian (Rhys Ifans) or Cassius\n                      (Tom &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister), to reign. Adrian and Cassius,\n                      hungry for power, decide to travel to New York City\n                      in order to spread Hell on Earth. Only Nicky can stop\n                      them and save his father--and the world--from his\n                      brothers' evil schemes. But Nicky has no idea what to\n                      expect from New York City, and he has to deal with new\n                      activities such as eating, sleeping, and meeting a new\n                      girlfriend, Valerie (Patricia Arquette). His friends\n                      Mr. Beefy, a talking bulldog, and John and Peter,\n                      a pair of hardcore heavy metal fans, try to help Nicky\n                      stand up for himself and eventually save the universe.\n                      LITTLE NICKY features a cast of regulars from other\n                      Adam Sandler movies, plus a hilariously bizarre sense\n                      of humor that allows all sorts of odd and twisted\n                      things to happen.\n______________________________________________________________________________\n        Subtitles: Swedish, Norweigan, Dannish, Soumi, Icelandic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c27b8f74039a9db504f2e2400c9ead609a20a8","amp;dn":"Little_Nicky.PAL.DVD-R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c27b8f74039a9db504f2e2400c9ead609a20a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,194,123,143,116,3,154,157,181,4,242,226,64,12,158,173,96,154,32,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
