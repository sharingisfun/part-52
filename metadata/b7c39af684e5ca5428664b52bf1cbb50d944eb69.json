Director Takita Yojiro takes a big step away from the aesthetic of his previous films Ashura-jo no Hitomi and When the Last Sword is Drawn to present a heartwarming story about youth and baseball. In addition to young leads Hayashi Kento and Yamada Kenta, who were especially selected for their baseball talents, Battery features an impressive veteran supporting cast including Kishitani Goro, Sugawara Bunta, and Amami Yuki.\n\nJunior high student Harada Takumi (Hayashi Kento) is a pitching prodigy, but his attitude and arrogance alienates him from schoolmates and even his own family. His father (Kishitani Goro) is completely uninterested in baseball, and his mother (Amami Yuki) spends most of her energy fussing over his ill younger brother (Yarita Akihiro). Takumi finally finds a friend and partner in classmate Nagakura Go (Yamada Kenta), a catcher who greatly admires Takumi&amp;#039;s pitching. Together they form a &quot;battery&quot; and join the school baseball team, but the friends have a falling out after a loss, bringing the team to a standstill. At this time, Takumi&amp;#039;s brother becomes seriously ill, and his only hope is for Takumi to win the big game for him.\n\n\nMedia Details\n=====================\nFilename.............: The.Battery.2007.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-PONY.avi\nFilesize.............: 700 MB (or 717,660 KB or 734,883,840 bytes)\nRuntime..............: 01:59:24 (171,768 fr)\nVideo Codec FourCC...: xvid\nVideo Codec Name.....: XviD\nVideo Frame Size.....: 720x304 (2.37:1) [=45:19]\nVideo Bitrate........: 718 kb/s\nVideo Framerate......: 23.976\nVideo Frame Quality..: 0.137 bits/pixel\nAudio Codec..........: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nAudio Bitrate........: 96 kb/s (48/ch, stereo) CBR\nAudio Framerate......: 48000 Hz\n\n\nSubtitle: ENGLISH fansub by me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7c39af684e5ca5428664b52bf1cbb50d944eb69","amp;dn":"The+Battery+%282007%29+ENG+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7c39af684e5ca5428664b52bf1cbb50d944eb69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,195,154,246,132,229,202,84,40,102,75,82,191,28,187,80,217,68,235,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
