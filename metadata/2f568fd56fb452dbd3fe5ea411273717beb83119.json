Its name is derived from the &quot;Succubus Club&quot;, a fictional location (and popular nightclub) in the World of Darkness, the setting for the game and others like it.\n\nA fictionalized quote, included in the compilations cover notes, and attributed to the fictional DJ Damascus (a DJ from The Succubus Club) states that &amp;#039;IÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ve noticed that each of these songs seems to strike a chord with a particular clan.&amp;#039; [1] In this sense, therefore, each track featured on the compilation may be linked to one of the fictional clans within the roleplaying world of Vampire: The Masquerade. In the track listing, below, each name in parentheses denotes the clan which each track represents.\n*******************************************************\n\\\\.Enjoy and Seed.//\n\\\\.torrent by CuriousInnuendo.//\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f568fd56fb452dbd3fe5ea411273717beb83119","amp;dn":"Music.from.the.Succubus.Club%5BWorld.of.Darkness-compilation%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f568fd56fb452dbd3fe5ea411273717beb83119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,86,143,213,111,180,82,219,211,254,94,164,17,39,55,23,190,184,49,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
