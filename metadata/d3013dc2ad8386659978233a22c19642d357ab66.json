If you wish to question my decision of making the ending the way it is, I appreciate the comments and will be glad to explain why I did that.\n\nYour intention for this fanedit: To portray the story from the perspective of Max, and to make it far more depressing than it previously was. \n\nYour way to achieve your intention: Cutting away everything that doesn&amp;#039;t feature Max, and make the ending way sader.\n\nTime needed for the edition: Planning: 115 minutes Editing: 2 days DVD making: 2 Days \n\npersons involved: messenjah14\n\n\n\nThis torrent also contains english subtitles and the cover art for the movie.\n\nREMEMBER, IF YOU DO NOT OWN THIS MOVIE, DON&amp;#039;T DOWNLOAD IT EITHER!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3013dc2ad8386659978233a22c19642d357ab66","amp;dn":"Max+-+A+Collateral+Fan+Edit+by+Messenjah14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3013dc2ad8386659978233a22c19642d357ab66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,1,61,194,173,131,134,101,153,120,35,58,34,193,150,66,211,87,171,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
