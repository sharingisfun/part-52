Plucked from Pawas&amp;#039; &quot;Playtex EP&quot; on the same label, here is an essential Daso remix for your listening and dancing pleasure... \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1026065&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1026065&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLabel:\tFear Of Flying\nCatalog#:\tFOF005-6\nFormat:\tVinyl, 12&quot;, EP\nCountry:\tGermany\nReleased:\t25 Jul 2007\nGenre:\tElectronic\nStyle:\tTechno, Minimal\n\n\nPawas - Playtex (Daso Remix) [7:38]\n\n\n17.4MB\n\n320KBps Digital Release.\n\n\nWe shall certainly get onto a bit of Pawas a little later in the schedule, who is a producer in the field of tech / minimal I am paying lots of attention to.  His remix of SCSI-9&amp;#039;s &quot;Kroy Menya V Pol Bita&quot; (on the schedule) continues to work wonders for me.\n\nDaso has stolen the show with this particular production though... it&amp;#039;s quite simply outstanding and I am completely addicted to it.\n\nAny persons new to or curious about the field of tech house and minimal techno are strongly urged to give this smooth and seductive treat a try.\n\n\n&quot; integrator &quot;... I just saw your comment on Mininova.  I&amp;#039;m ever so pleased that you have found you way back to the schedule since Demonoid has been on the blink, and of course you are most welcome my friend.  Let&amp;#039;s hope the little green fiend gets up and running again in the new year!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n\nthemagicke\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&lt;/a&gt;\n                                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34bf950043bb9e076210245a132d9616539a831e","amp;dn":"Pawas+-+Playtex+%28Daso+Remix+2007%29+%5BTech+House+%2F+Minimal+Techno%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34bf950043bb9e076210245a132d9616539a831e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,191,149,0,67,187,158,7,98,16,36,90,19,45,150,22,83,154,131,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
