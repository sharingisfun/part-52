Stages begin with a dialogue sequence as the characters confront one another, then proceed to grid-based battles. When you target an opponent, the game switches to a side-view attack sequence where button inputs determine the moves that your characters perform. \n\n\n\nThe password to the rar-file is included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9efc4cc465189614ad22956e01a6a236f2417354","amp;dn":"NamcoXCapcom+JAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9efc4cc465189614ad22956e01a6a236f2417354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,252,76,196,101,24,150,20,173,34,149,110,1,166,162,54,242,65,115,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
