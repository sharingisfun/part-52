I have been accused of being slow before but I couldn&amp;#039;t care less.\n\nThe Whigs have made a great album. They&amp;#039;ll become the new hype. Mark my words.\nWatch out for the Poodles. They&amp;#039;re not at all like their name suggests! Strong album!\nSteve Earle&amp;#039;s album was so good that I just couldn&amp;#039;t choose between these two songs. \nThe same goes for the Good Shoes album. I just took the first two songs to make it easy on myself. The second song reminds me a little of Maximo Park. \nHot Chip made a wonderful album with this song for the dance floor. \nOn MySpace of &quot;What Made Milwaukee Famous&quot; they state that one of their influences  is Jeff Buckley. This song and the singer make that very clear. Beautiful song and beautifully sung. \nCat Power has made another covers album. She&amp;#039;s got guts taking on this Billy Holiday song, but truly makes it her own.\n\nAnd the oldies? Well, Joe Jackson has made a new album called &quot;Rain&quot;. He&amp;#039;s trying to go back to his roots, but although the album&amp;#039;s not bad, it&amp;#039;s not at all like his Look Sharp-days.\nPatty Larkin, in her mid 50&amp;#039;s already, has produced, performed and written a true alt. country album with influences from around the world. And what a voice! And she plays eleven instruments.  \nIan Hunter is 68 and going strong. His album is not bad at all and has some great songs if you skip the first two. It&amp;#039;s clear that he never really was a glam-rocker. His voice is great and sometimes sounds like an English Bob Dylan. \n\n01 The Whigs - Like A Vibration\n02 British Sea Power - No Need To Cry\n03 Patty Larkin - Beautiful\n04 Steve Earle - Red Is The Color\n05 Richard Hawley - Roll River Roll\n06 Black Mountain - Stormy High\n07 The Loved Ones - Sarah&amp;#039;s Game\n08 The Poodles - Flesh And Blood\n09 Ian Hunter - Stretch\n10 Steve Earle - Satellite Radio\n11 Good Shoes - Nazanin\n12 Good Shoes - The Photos On My Wall\n13 Dengue Fever - Sober Driver\n14 Say Hi - Northwestern Girls\n15 Aaron Robinson - The New AM\n16 What Made Milwaukee Famous - Resistance St.\n17 The Mountain Goats - Sax Rohmer #1\n18 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Paper Aeroplane\n19 Joe Jackson - King Pleasure Time\n20 Alec Empire - New Man\n21 Hot Chip - Ready For The Floor\n22 Cat Power - Don&amp;#039;t Explain\n\nDon&amp;#039;t be shy to give me some suggestions too! I have absolutely no idea who is downloading my choices.\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to check out the Shank and have fun! (Like I did!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda85df03f71c03e94c9f9fe443bd6b16b79ac1f","amp;dn":"Bluegamba%5C%27s+Choice+No.+13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda85df03f71c03e94c9f9fe443bd6b16b79ac1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,168,93,240,63,113,192,62,148,201,249,254,68,59,214,177,107,121,172,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
