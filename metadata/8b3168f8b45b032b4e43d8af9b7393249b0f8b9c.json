Tristan Thorn\n   Ian McKellen ...  Narrator (voice)\n   Alastair MacIntosh ...  Victorian Academic \n   David Kelly ...  Guard \n   Ben Barnes ...  Young Dunstan Thorn \n   \n    \nSummary:\n\n  I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.\n\n  Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.
