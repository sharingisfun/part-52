If you don&amp;#039;t know what that is, then go check out:\n&gt; http://www.theorangebox.com/ or whatever.\n&gt;\n&gt; About the files:\n&gt; The &quot;Looping Radio Mix&quot; is just ripped from the portal files. and i\n&gt; compressed it to mp3 format to save on space. The &quot;Phone Ringer&quot; is one i\n&gt; mixed up using the radio mix as a background and several turret voices for\n&gt; some humor. They are both 128kbs/44.1khz/mono. Also these files have ONLY\n&gt; been tested on a Motorola Razr V3M so i don&amp;#039;t know (or care) if they will\n&gt; work on your phone. if they don&amp;#039;t try converting them to your format. But ON\n&gt; the razr, asuming how your network is set up (mine is AT&amp;T) the &quot;Phone\n&gt; Ringer&quot; one i made ends with &quot;I don&amp;#039;t hate you&quot; before it goes to voice mail.\n&gt; so it (just like the fact that you are adopted) is funny.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also. since you are obviously downloading these from a similiar tracker that i\n&gt; use, you can get the game from the following locations:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://torrents.thepiratebay.se/3837572/Portal-Unleashed.3837572.TPB.torrent\n&gt; http://isohunt.com/download/27422783/unleashed\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; -- Rellik\n&gt; Thank you for helping us, help you, help us all.\n&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75b968ec05e2056696d14c142bd4f4a8d86c527e","amp;dn":"HL2+-+Portal+Ringers+%5BRPD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75b968ec05e2056696d14c142bd4f4a8d86c527e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,185,104,236,5,226,5,102,150,209,76,20,43,212,244,168,216,108,82,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
