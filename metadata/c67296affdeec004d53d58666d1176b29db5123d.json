And feel better about yours.\n\nPlot Outline:\nAfter eighteen seasons, four hundred episodes, and innumerable awards and honors (including a Peabody, 23 Emmys(R) and a designation from Time magazine as the &quot;best television show of the twentieth century&quot;), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has become a feature-length motion picture. And it&amp;#039;s a good thing, too, because it takes a wide screen to fully capture Homer Simpson&amp;#039;s epic stupidity.\n\nIn the eagerly-awaited film based on the hit television series, Homer must save the world from a catastrophe he himself created. It all begins with Homer, his new pet pig, and a leaky silo full of droppings - a combination that triggers a disaster the likes of which Springfield has never experienced. As Marge is outraged by Homer&amp;#039;s monumental blunder, a vengeful mob descends on the Simpson household. The family makes a narrow escape, but is soon divided by both location and conflict.\n\nThe Springfield citizenry has every reason to be out for Simpson blood. The calamity triggered by Homer has drawn the attention of U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger (voiced by Harry Shearer) and Environmental Protection Agency head Russ Cargill (voiced by Albert Brooks). &quot;You know sir,&quot; Cargill tells the president, &quot;when you made me head of the EPA, you were applauded for appointing one of the most successful men in America to the least successful agency in government. And why did I take the job? Because I&amp;#039;m a rich man who wanted to give something back. Not the money, but something.&quot; That &quot;something&quot; is a devil&amp;#039;s plan to contain the disaster.\n\nAs the fates of Springfield and the world hang in the balance, Homer embarks on a personal odyssey of redemption - seeking forgiveness from Marge, the reunion of his splintered family, and the salvation of his hometown.\n\nCast\n\t\t \t\nDan Castellaneta\t ... \tHomer Simpson/Itchy/Barney/Grampa/Stage Manager/Krusty the Clown/Mayor Quimby/Mayor&amp;#039;s Aide/Multi-Eyed Squirrel/Panicky Man/Sideshow Mel/Mr. Teeny/EPA Official/Kissing Cop #1/Bear/Boy on Phone/NSA Worker/Officer/Santa&amp;#039;s Little Helper/Squeaky-Voiced Teen (voice)\n\tJulie Kavner\t... \tMarge Simpson (voice)\n\n\tNancy Cartwright\t... \tBart Simpson/Maggie Simpson/Ralph/Nelson/Todd Flanders/TV Daughter/Woman on Phone (voice)\n\n\tYeardley Smith\t... \tLisa Simpson (voice)\n\n\tHarry Shearer\t... \tScratchy/Mr. Burns/Rev.
