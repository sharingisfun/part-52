Video is original. I also could keep all three language menus. Menus are now fast. No animation between menus.\nIf you don&amp;#039;t need extras this is then better you can buy from store. Same video and audio quality, no warnings etc. and fast menus.\n\nWhen you look the source VTS 7 progran chains are 4053 MB same than my version.\nIn original There was 32 VTS now only 9. I edited manually PGC commands.\nI compared this to other releases and checked one VOB file with Bitrate viewer.\n0.99 GB VTS_07_3.VOB Avarage bitrate: 5391 and Peak: 8385\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76aa6366d23027b145d0333d4af6118c8c11177c","amp;dn":"Shrek.The.Third.2007.SE.FI.DVDR-v666","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76aa6366d23027b145d0333d4af6118c8c11177c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,170,99,102,210,48,39,177,69,208,51,61,74,246,17,140,140,17,23,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
