The higher quality video and audio rips combined with interesting dvd menus make this a lot better than the other versions around. You can watch the full movie and toggle between 3 audio tracks: the original Wizard of Oz audio, the Dark Side of the Moon, or both. It also has a scene selection, so you can jump to a specific chapter if you want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4660339997193abcc1d40368ead8fd33ea7c096b","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Side+of+Oz+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4660339997193abcc1d40368ead8fd33ea7c096b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,96,51,153,151,25,58,188,193,212,3,104,234,216,253,51,234,124,9,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
