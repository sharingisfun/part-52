This spree revolves around the set of &quot;Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro&quot;, and each cast member is getting killed off one by one in the same order they die in the script. With the help of her ex-boyfriend Dewey Riley (David Arquette), who has connections to the cast of Stab 3; Gale and Dewey set out to solve who&amp;#039;s doing this and who&amp;#039;s next. After each murder, the killer leaves a photograph of Maureen Prescott (Sidney&amp;#039;s mother). Could this be clues to the killer&amp;#039;s motive, or simply just bait to lure main-target Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) out of hiding? The only keys Dewey, Sidney and Gale have to surviving this third unpredictable killing-spree are: the clues the killer leaves behind, the Stab 3 script, and a video-tape left by old pal Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy).\n\nEnglish Language.\n\nBrought to you by V3n0m.
