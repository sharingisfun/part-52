Essentially a revision of the Supermarine Attacker, the type evolved through several marques, eventually arriving at the FR.5, which was the most numerous. Incorporating tricycle gear and an afterburning engine, this aircraft held the world speed record for a scant 24 hours, when it was again broken by the Douglas F4D Skyray. The FR.5 utilised a &quot;sawtooth&quot; leading edge on the main wing (adding stability at high angles of attack) and remained operational until the summer of 1961. A later development, the FR.7, was adapted to the reconnaissance role, with a dozen of these being produced.\n\n** FS2004 only **\n\nFeatures -\n\n- high-detail textures\n- realistic soundset\n- 2 models, one with ventral tank\n- authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls\n- authentic all-xml 2D panel, custom pop-ups for autopilot and radios, fully mousable\n- automatic (on throttle) afterburner visual effect with corresponding performance boost\n- animated exhaust clamshell\n- animated canopy (shift-e)\n- highly authentic flight model with checklist\n- v-c rain effects\n- realistic, animated crew figure\n- automatic smoke trail effect\n- working landing lights","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f2ff4d55291e5d522a74f5aff15721a1f88951","amp;dn":"FS2004+Alphasim+Supermarine+Swift.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f2ff4d55291e5d522a74f5aff15721a1f88951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,242,255,77,85,41,30,93,82,42,116,245,175,241,87,33,161,248,137,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
