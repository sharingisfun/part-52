He can see people in darkened windows at night from two hundred yards, hear the music playing on the radio of the car he&amp;#039;s chasing after he&amp;#039;s lost sight of it, and can distinguish between wood and plastic after both have been in a three thousand degree fire. Blair Sandburg, a local anthropology student, tells Ellison that he is a &quot;Sentinel,&quot; who in ancient tribes would protect the village and seek out game using such hyperactive senses. Sandburg becomes Ellison&amp;#039;s back-watcher and teacher of how to use his new powers as Ellison brings a whole new edge to the war on crime in Cascade, Washington.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e241a85470e873cc26b18e06c6641650ecd1006e","amp;dn":"The+Sentinel+%281996%29+s01e01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e241a85470e873cc26b18e06c6641650ecd1006e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,65,168,84,112,232,115,204,38,177,142,6,198,100,22,80,236,209,0,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
