Rough, heroic without these easy-going choruses! Here epic, there fast, then doomy! SKULLVIEW are one of the few, who still manage to emanate the flair of the Eighties! It's obvious to me that only quite few people still are receptive to this kind of style! Their fault, shall they praise their gods - I praise mine!\n\nThe Epic Metal of the first two albums has been continued, but I think that this epos sounds more mature and rounder than ever before. The production, too, is the best so far. The vocals are brilliant, just imagine Bruce Dickinson screaming coupled with the roughness of a Tim Baker (CIRITH UNGOL). Vocals that 99% of all young Metalians won't even be able to stand for more than one minute! But you fools! If you think that SLIPKNOT or LIMP BIZKIT are Metal, then you are lost!\n\nTen songs can be found on this more than one hour long epos, among them a good rendition of BLACK SABBATH's &quot;Digital Bitch&quot;. And with the song &quot;Skullview (Warrior)&quot; they have a hot contender for the award &quot;Best song of the year&quot;. This track is absolutely divine! Incredible! And also the fastest SKULLVIEW-song so far, with a fat OMEN-touch!\n\nAs the rest also is more than convincing I just have to award them with 9 points! SKULLVIEW rule supreme! All hail to them!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e6b055fd7537411c63fe1ce165a3eb5902377b1","amp;dn":"Skullview+-+Consequences+Of+Failure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e6b055fd7537411c63fe1ce165a3eb5902377b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,107,5,95,215,83,116,17,198,63,225,206,22,90,62,181,144,35,119,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
