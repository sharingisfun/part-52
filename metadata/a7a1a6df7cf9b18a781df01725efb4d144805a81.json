And Brian \ninterviews a top diplomat in Afghanistan on surprising signs that the Taliban&amp;#039;s \npower may on the decline.\n\nThis week, tragedy hangs over Burma, or as it is also known, Myanmar. Gone, the \nimage of one hundred thousand peaceful demonstrators marching on the streets of \nRangoon, to protest against the repressive military dictatorship. For a while, \nit looked like change might really be ahead for a country that has been closed \noff from the rest of the world. The marches were the biggest pro democracy \nprotests in a generation. But military gunfire ended all that in a violent \ncrackdown. At first there was video footage of the shootings and the brutal \nbeatings. Now, the dictatorship has cut off most information coming out of the \ncountry. Diplomats&amp;#039; reports and news items describe mass arrests; knocks on \ndoors in the middle of the night as soldiers round people up, in many cases, \nbrutally murdering the monks who led the protests. Reports are still sketchy \nand we&amp;#039;re still waiting to hear about the full situation in Myanmar.\n\nThe CBC&amp;#039;s Patrick Brown is one of the few reporters who has been able to get \ninto the country in recent years. He has filed stories on the underground \ndemocracy movement and on persecuted minorities there. We present two of his \nreports, which give insight into the character of the military regime. In the \nfirst report, Patrick reflects on the significance of the recent mass protests. \nThe second report, produced seven years ago, includes a very rare interview \nwith the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, who \nhas been under house arrest for eighteen years.\n\nHere at home Canadians remain deeply divided over Afghanistan, as they try to \nbalance their willingness to help a devastated country with their growing alarm \nabout casualties and rising violence. Janice Stein, a leading authority on \nconflict zones heads one of Canada&amp;#039;s largest think tanks on foreign affairs, \nthe Munk Centre for International Studies. She recently returned from a \nresearch trip to Afghanistan and has co-authored a much-anticipated book on \nCanada&amp;#039;s involvement called, &quot;The Unexpected War&quot; due out later this month. \nBrian speaks with her about the mission and what might happen when it ends. \nLast winter, when Brian was in Kabul, he interviewed Chris Alexander, the UN&amp;#039;s \ntop diplomatic troubleshooter in Afghanistan. Alexander is a former Canadian \nambassador to Afghanistan and knows the country, where he still works, \nextraordinarily well. He was recently in Canada, and Brian talked to him about \nthe rumors of peace talks in Afghanistan.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
