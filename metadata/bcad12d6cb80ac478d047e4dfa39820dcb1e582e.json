Rating:  3.9 / 5 (based on 18 ratings). What did you think of it?  \n\nPlot: Hailed as Donnie Yen&amp;#039;s best work, superior even to the much-loved &quot;SPL&quot; (aka &quot;Kill Zone&quot;), this film is about a martial arts academy called &quot;Dragon Tiger Gate&quot;, where three orphans learn kung fu from a master and must soon put it into practice. \n \nOverview: Tiger Wong (Nicholas Tse) unwittingly takes Lousha Death Plague, a token decreed by the leader of the Lousha Gate, Shibumi, hence is ambushed by triad gangs. As fate has it, Dragon Wong (Donnie Yen), a bodyguard works for a triad boss, saves Tiger and discovers that Tiger is his brother. Turbo Shek (Shawn Yue), a blonde youth who plays nunchakus, meanwhile, befriends with the brothers in the fierce fight. In the super power showdown and endless killings in the Jiang Hu, only these three back street boys can fight for justice in the community. \nThis film is a tale of heroism and heart-pounding martial arts piece adapted from media magnate Tony Wong Yuk-Long&amp;#039;s well-known comic. This sensational action packed film transfuses the spirit of the period style martial arts with a modern touch. Its fights are fantastical yet authentic and innovative; imagery lavish yet realistic. \n\nCast: Nicholas Tse Ting-Fung  ||  Donnie Yen Ji-Dan  ||  Shawn Yu Man-Lok  ||  Tung Jei  ||  Vincent Sze  ||  Li Xiao-Ran  ||  Chen Kuan-Tai  ||  Yuen Wah  ||  Tony Wong Yuk-Long  ||  Xing Yu  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.539333/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.539333/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
