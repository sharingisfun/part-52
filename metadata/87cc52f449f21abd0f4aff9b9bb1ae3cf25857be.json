Musically they remind me of a rougher and more Hammond-drenched version of bands like Earth and Fire and Sandrose. A female singer with a very varied and enjoyable voice fronted them. She could take her voice up in a high soprano on the beautiful &quot;Weeping My Endure&quot; and then in a &quot;lower&quot; tone in the rocking &quot;The Years at the Spring&quot;. The other most dominating part in their sound is a really delightful and thick Hammond organ-sound the way we like it. All the songs here are good. The title-track is with its nine minutes the longest and most complex one, going from energetic riffs to quiet parts where the organ and guitar creates some really mystical and haunting atmospheres. The opening track &quot;Dark Reflections&quot; is with its dramatic vocals, excellent melodic chorus and swirling organ-passages one of the very best tracks on the album. &quot;Indian Meditation&quot; features wordless vocals and some flute that fits well to the title of the track. &quot;Analogy&quot; is yet another lost classic of 70's progressive rock.\n\nAnalogy\nAnalogy  1972\nat 256Kbps\n\nTrack listing\n1.
