Also included is the new song, &quot;Live Through Me.&quot; The production is a little crazy and ambitious, unlike whatever I put out for 2008 which will be stripped down and subdued. But track one is really the first song I wrote that made me feel like I had something worthwhile to contribute to the world of musical expression.\n\nThese are the tracks that have been praised sporadically by fans. \n\n\nTHIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://001collective.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://001collective.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f65bc54e46d4202c8e88b8ec84619fcb1cc8a36","amp;dn":"James+Eric+-+Tonight+The+Moon+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f65bc54e46d4202c8e88b8ec84619fcb1cc8a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,101,188,84,228,109,66,2,200,232,139,142,200,70,25,252,177,204,138,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
