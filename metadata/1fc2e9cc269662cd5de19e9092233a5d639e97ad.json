He explores how the Canadian \nmilitary is selling the mission and boosting public support for it, as it also \nincreases its political clout in Ottawa.\n\nBrian writes: &quot;In my reporting on the war in Afghanistan, I have often thought \nit interesting that despite Canada&amp;#039;s costly involvement there, we have seen \nvery little change in public attitudes towards the mission. If, two years ago, \none had forecast that dozens of Canadians would be killed in Southern \nAfghanistan by 2007, with no clear success to the mission in sight, one might \nhave predicted a strong current of anti-war sentiment emerging by now.\n\nWhile there has been widespread criticism of the government&amp;#039;s &quot;lack of clarity&quot; \nover Afghanistan, Canadians are today still equally divided; roughly half for \nthe misson, half against. Remarkably, Canadians on the whole still support the \nmission more than civilians in European NATO countries do; even though we&amp;#039;ve \ntaken more casualties, and face tougher fighting. So what has held up this \nlevel of support? It is, in part , because of a well-planned, but little \nunderstood, campaign by the military itself to control our perceptions of the \nconflict. In my regular &quot;Inside the Mission&quot; reports for the National News, \nI&amp;#039;ve been stuck by the massive public relations campaign orchestrated by \nCanada&amp;#039;s top soldier General Rick Hillier. It led to my documentary \nexploration of this military PR offensive, one unprecedented since the Second \nWorld War. &quot; The documentary was produced by Harry Schachter and edited by \nClaude Panet-Raymond.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
