Included are 2 custom Tenacious D wallpapers and a custom D THM.\n\nThis is the concert that is on the Tenacious D DVD the Complete Materworks.  This concert was recorded at London's Brixton Academy on November 3, 2002. \n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388462/\n\nReview on imdb:\nTenacious D, quite possibly live up to their claim as &quot;the greatest band on Earth&quot;. No one will make you laugh more than the D, and as they are undeniably great musicians as well, you get two for the price of one, comedy and great music.\n\nJB and KG are the perfect double team, playing off each other perfectly and KG's lead guitar work is remarkable. JB has a massive vocal range and watching this is just an enjoyable experience all round.\n\nBe sure to look out for JB's guitar solo in &quot;Rock Your Socks&quot; in the concert, couldn't stop laughing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae3a457af4a78e91ddf55b1249240ef59248620a","amp;dn":"PSP+-+MP4+Tenacious+D+Live+in+London+%7BPSPsychoz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae3a457af4a78e91ddf55b1249240ef59248620a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,58,69,122,244,167,142,145,221,245,91,18,73,36,14,245,146,72,98,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
