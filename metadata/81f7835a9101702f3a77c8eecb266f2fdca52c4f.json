But as time passed and Evan has made up with Bruce, he&amp;#039;s gone onto bigger and better things. Newly elected to Washington D.C. as a congressman, Evan has left Buffalo, New York in pursuit of a greater calling. But that calling isn&amp;#039;t serving in the illustrious ranks of America&amp;#039;s politics, but being summoned by the Almighty himself (Morgan Freeman), who has handed Evan the task of building a new ark, much as Noah did before. With time passing by and his family belittled by Evan&amp;#039;s newfound realization, Evan will have to do the work that God has given him in what promises to be an unusual adventure for a man who just wanted to serve his country, might actually be serving humanity\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f7835a9101702f3a77c8eecb266f2fdca52c4f","amp;dn":"Evan+Almighty_dvdrip_david5503","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f7835a9101702f3a77c8eecb266f2fdca52c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,247,131,90,145,1,112,47,58,119,200,238,203,38,111,47,220,165,44,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
