are...\n\nSo this year i wanted to get involved and do all i could early...\n\nAnd i found myself torn...\nbecause this time it?s not that simple...\nour choices aren?t as clear as the last elections ...\nlast time it was so obvious...\nBush and war\nvs\nno Bush and no war...\n\nBut this time it?s not that simple...\nand there are a lot of people that are torn just like i am...\n\nSo for awhile I put it off and i was going to wait until it was decided for me...\n\nAnd then came New Hampshire...\n\nAnd i was captivated...\n\nInspired...\n\nI reflected on my life...\nand the blessings I have...\nand the people who fought for me to have these rights and blessings...\n\nand I?m not talking about a &quot;black thing&quot;\nI?m talking about a &quot;human thing&quot; me as a &quot;person&quot;\nan American...\n\nThat speech made me think of Martin Luther King...\nKennedy...\nand Lincoln...\nand all the others that have fought for what we have today...\n\nwhat America is &quot;supposed&quot; to be...\n\nfreedom...\nequality...\nand truth...\n\nand thats not what we have today...\nwe think we are free...\nbut in reality terror and fear controls our decisions...\n\nthis is not the America that our pioneers and leaders fought and\ndied for...\n\nand then there was New Hampshire\n\nit was that speech...\nlike many great speeches...\nthat one moved me...\nbecause words and ideas are powerful...\n\nIt made me think...\nand realize that today we have &quot;very few&quot; leaders...\nmaybe none...\n\nbut that speech...\n\nit inspired me...\nit inspired me to look inside myself and outwards towards the world...\nit inspired me to want to change myself to better the world...\nand take a &quot;leap&quot; towards change...\nand hope that others become inspired to do the same...\nchange themselves..\nchange their greed...\nchange their fears...\nand if we &quot;change that&quot;\n&quot;then hey&quot;..\nwe got something right...???...\n\n1 week later after the speech settled in me...\nI began making this song...\nI came up with the idea to turn his speech into a song...\nbecause that speech effected and touched my inner core like nothing in a very long time...\n\nit spoke to me...\n\nbecause words and ideas are powerful...\n\nI just wanted to add a melody to those words...\nI wanted the inspiration that was bubbling inside me to take over...\n\nso i let it..\n\nI wasn&amp;#039;t afraid to stand for something...\nto stand for &quot;change&quot;...\nI wasn&amp;#039;t afraid of &quot;fear&quot;...\nit was pure inspiration...\n\nso I called my friends...\nand they called their friends...\nin a matter of 2 days...\nWe made the song and video...\n\nUsually this process would take months...\na bunch of record company people figuring out strategies and release dates...\ninterviews...\nall that stuff...\nbut this time i took it in my own hands...\nso i called my friends sarah pantera, mike jurkovac, fred goldring, and jesse dylan to help make it happen...\nand they called their friends..\nand we did it together in 48 hours...\nand instead of putting it in the hands of profit we put it in the hands of inspiration...\n\nthen we put it on the net for the world to feel...\n\nWhen you are truly inspired..\nmagic happens...\nincredible things happen...\nlove happens..\n(and with that combination)\n\n&quot;love, and inspiration&quot;\n\nchange happens...\n\n&quot;change for the better&quot;\nInspiration breeds change...\n\n&quot;Positive change&quot;...\n\nno one on this planet is truly experienced to handle the obstacles we face today...\nTerror, fear, lies, agendas, politics, money, all the above...\nIt?s all scary...\n\nMartin Luther King didn&amp;#039;t have experience to lead...\nKennedy didn&amp;#039;t have experience to lead...\nSusan B. Anthony...\nNelson Mandella...\nRosa Parks...\nGandhi...\nAnne Frank...\nand everyone else who has had a hand in molding the freedoms we have and take for granted today...\n\nno one truly has experience to deal with the world today...\n\nthey just need &quot;desire, strength, courage ability, and passion&quot; to change...\nand to stand for something even when people say it&amp;#039;s not possible...\n\nAmerica would not be here &quot;today&quot; if we didn?t stand and fight for\nchange &quot;yesterday&quot;...\nEverything we have as a &quot;people&quot; is because of the &quot;people&quot; who fought for\nchange...\nand whoever is the President has to realize we have a lot of changing to do\n\nI&amp;#039;m not trying to convince people to see things how i do...\nI produced this song to share my new found inspiration and how I&amp;#039;ve been moved...\nI hope this song will make you feel...\nlove...\nand think...\nand be inspired just like the speech inspired me...\n\nthat?s all...\n\n\n\nLet&amp;#039;s all come together like America is supposed to...\nLike Japan did after Hiroshima...\n\nthat was less than 65 years ago...\nand look at Japan now...\n\nthey did it together...\nthey did it...\n\n&quot;We can&amp;#039;t?...\n\nAre you serious..?..\n\nWE CAN!!!\n\nYes we can...\nA United &quot;America&quot;\nDemocrats, Republicans and Independents together...\nBuilding a new America\n\nWe can do it...\n&quot;TOGETHER&quot;\n\nPlease visit www.yeswecansong.com\n\nThank you for reading and listening...\nwill.i.am \n\t  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd38682bf0311ae56e500b497ef4e1f976c0e4e8","amp;dn":"Yes+We+Can++-+Obama+Song.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd38682bf0311ae56e500b497ef4e1f976c0e4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,56,104,43,240,49,26,229,110,80,11,73,126,244,225,249,118,192,228,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
