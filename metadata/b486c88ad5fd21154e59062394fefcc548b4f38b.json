The details of these exploits are still not entirely public. These missions could be extremely dangerous, the Soviet Air Force being given tacit approval to shoot down the Neptunes on sight without paying too much heed to whether or not the plane was actually in international air space. The most famous Neptune was a P2V-1, the &quot;Truculent Turtle&quot;, which flew non-stop without refueling from Perth, Australia, to Columbus, Ohio, a distance of 11,235 miles. This type, P2V-7, was first flown in 1954. In 1962 it was re-designated as the SP-2H, OP-2E, or AP-2H. The Neptune served until the mid 1970&amp;#039;s, when it was replaced by the P-3 Orion.\n\n** FS2004 and FSX only **\n\nFeatures - \n\nFIVE texture sets :\n\n1. VP-1, Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, 1968\n2.
