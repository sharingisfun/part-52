A FAN EDIT is a film modified by a fan/viewer to change either the film\\\\\\&amp;#039;s pacing, artistic merit, or add/delete specific scenes to alter to overall viewing experience.\n\nPIECES: Grindhouse Edition contains the following changes which differ from the official release:\n\n-During the title sequence, a title card reading \\\\\\&quot;One Thousand Cries Has The Night\\\\\\&quot; is sloppily inserted over the original \\\\\\&quot;Pieces\\\\\\&quot; title card.\n-Inserted a quick shot of the freaky mask just before the axe meets the mother\\\\\\&amp;#039;s head in the intro to the film.\n-The scene when the popular girl on the skateboard crashes into the giant mirror is deleted, to remove poinltess and goofy comic relief.\n-Inserted a \\\\\\&quot;Missing Reel\\\\\\&quot; segment right before the girl at the pool removes her top. The scene picks up when the killer is seen dragging a blood-soaked garbage bag.\n-When the cop yells \\\\\\&quot;STOP! Or I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT!\\\\\\&quot;, I warped the word \\\\\\&quot;BRAINS\\\\\\&quot; to sound like a film-induced audio glitch.\n-Added additional film damage/grain when the girl is attacked in the elevator. Later, when the police discover her body, I zoomed-in, tilted and inverted the shot of the officer vomiting.\n-Added another \\\\\\&quot;Missing Reel\\\\\\&quot; segment when the boy has sex, and the under cover Linda Day is attacked by the Kung-Fu instructor. I only show the reporter\\\\\\&amp;#039;s death scene and continue with the killer going to his hidden closet.\n-Removed the infamous \\\\\\&quot;Bastard...Bastard...BASTARD!\\\\\\&quot; line.\n-Added addition film damage/grain throughout various parts of the film.\n\nPresented in it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Roughly 10 minutes removed. Download contains DVD Artwork and the film in VOB format. The DVD contains an opening \\\\\\&quot;Grindhouse\\\\\\&quot; trailer show before the film starts.\n\nENJOY AND SEED!
