The country of Bialya was almost totally destroyed by Black Adam?s rampage, and both Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent set out to try to provide relief to the war-ravaged country in their own ways. Meanwhile, Veronica Cale?s part in the creation of the Four Horsemen begins to weigh on her, forcing a confrontation with Wonder Woman. As the trinity mobilizes though, the Four Horsemen are on the move again.\n\nThis miniseries has been billed as giving the Big Three a chance to get in on some of the action they missed during their year off. Giffen (who had no small part in 52 himself) is quite successful, in this first issue, at establishing the Horsemen as a threat even to Superman, but still manages to maintain an air of mystery about them. What made them work so effectively in 52, after all, was the element of surprise, particularly the Sobek betrayal. Giffen plays up the monster movie vibe, with hints of vampire and zombie lore liberally scattered throughout.\n\nThanks to the original scanners and uploaders.\n\nPlease keep seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0c08f926f897ec13cf3318718215589c897d94","amp;dn":"DC+52+Aftermath+-+The+Four+Horseman+%5BBigBonedNinja%5D%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0c08f926f897ec13cf3318718215589c897d94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,12,8,249,38,248,151,236,19,207,51,24,113,130,21,88,156,137,125,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
