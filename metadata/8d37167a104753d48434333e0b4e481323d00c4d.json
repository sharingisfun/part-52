Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) has finally met the man of her dreams, Dr. Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan). There?s just one problem - his mother! Overbearing and controlling, not to mention volatile, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda) has recently been canned from her job as a star news anchor. Fearing she will lose her son?s affections as she has her career, Viola decides to break up the happy couple by becoming the world?s worst mother-in-law. Helping her with her crazy schemes is Viola?s long-time assistant, Ruby (Wanda Sykes). The gloves come off when Charlie finally decides to fight back and it looks like Viola has finally met her match. Scheduled for a mid-summer 2005 release, Monster-in-Law is directed by Legally Blonde?s Robert Luketic and marks Fonda?s return to the big screen after a 14-year absence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d37167a104753d48434333e0b4e481323d00c4d","amp;dn":"Monster+in+Law+-+2005+-+DVDRip+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d37167a104753d48434333e0b4e481323d00c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,55,22,122,16,71,83,212,132,52,51,62,11,78,72,19,35,208,12,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
