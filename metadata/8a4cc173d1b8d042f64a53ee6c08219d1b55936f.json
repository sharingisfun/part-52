The film is largely set in Hong Kong.\n\nAmong the stuntmen for the film were members of the Seven Little Fortunes, including Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. This was arguably instrumental in Chan and Hung\\&amp;#039;s further association with Golden Harvest studios, which later launched their careers. The portly Hung is shown fighting Lee in the opening sequence of the movie.\n\nThe finished version of the film was significantly different from the original screenplay drafts as Bruce Lee revised much of the script himself, including having written and directed the films opening Shaolin Temple fight sequence. Lee wanted to use the film as a vehicle for expressing what he saw as the beauty of his Chinese culture, rather than it being just another action movie[citation needed].\n\nThe Warner Brothers Special 25th Anniversary Edition DVD includes footage from the only surviving TV interview of Bruce Lee (which aired on December 9, 1971 with Canadian journalist Pierre Burton) Also included in this special DVD release are a few minutes of added movie footage which is philosophical in tone, but was cut from the original theatrical release. In addition, there is a good amount of behind the scenes footage and extensive interview segments on various topics about Lee by his widow Linda Lee Caldwell.\n\n\nEnter the Dragon \nDirected by Robert Clouse \nProduced by Fred Weintraub\nPaul Heller \nWritten by Michael Allin \nStarring Bruce Lee\nJohn Saxon\nAhna Capri\nShih Kien\nRobert Wall\nAngela Mao\nBetty Chung\nGeoffrey Weeks\nPeter Archer\nJim Kelly\nBolo Yeung \nMusic by Lalo Schifrin \nDistributed by Warner Brothers \nRelease date(s) Hong Kong July 26, 1973\nUSA August 17, 1973 \nRunning time 98 min. \nLanguage English \n\n\nLength.......................: 01h 42m 24s \n\n[Video]\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nOrig.
