LAMEWIN32.EXE was a distribution of\nmp3-tech.org, at least as far as L.A.M.E. 3.94 and RazorLame 1.1.5.\nHowever, for reasons unknown to the PfP team, pre-compiled binary\ninstallers of LAMEWIN32.EXE are no longer available for download from\nmp3-tech.org. We assume that this has something to do with the IP\nholders of the .mp3 technology, but that\\&amp;#039;s only a guess. In any event,\nyour friendly PfP team has decided to make available a current version\nof LAMEWIN32.EXE. Install and Enjoy! This REALLY IS THE BEST MP3\nENCODER and GUI (FRONT-END)\n\nPfP - November 5, 2007\n\n\nP.S. - FEEL FREE TO PASS IT AROUND.
