This action saga takes place on the battleship USS Missouri, about to be decommissioned from service after a visit from George Bush. When Bush departs the vessel, a band of terrorists overcome the remaining skeleton crew and take over the ship, under the ruse of holding a surprise birthday party for the ship&amp;#039;s commander, Captain Adams (Patrick O&amp;#039;Neal). The band is led by Strannix (Jones), a disgruntled ex-CIA operative, and his right-hand man, the psychotic Krill (Busey). The terrorists plan to steal the ship&amp;#039;s store of nuclear warheads, transfer them to a stolen North Korean submarine, and sell them to a Middle Eastern country. Unfortunately for Strannix, he has overlooked the ship&amp;#039;s cook, Casey Ryback (Seagal). Ryback is a much-honored Navy SEAL who, because of a minor scandal, is quietly completing his twenty-year tour in the galley of the Missouri. Forced into action, Ryback, along with the woman who jumped out of Captain Adams&amp;#039; birthday cake (Erika Eleniak), knocks off the bad guys one-by-one while crawling inside the bowels of the ship.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n                 E  L  E  C  T  R  I  C \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c489e4d55109a490fe92330cef1ef5d9b43ebba","amp;dn":"Under.Siege.UNCUT.DVDrip-electric","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c489e4d55109a490fe92330cef1ef5d9b43ebba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,72,158,77,85,16,154,73,15,233,35,48,206,241,239,93,155,67,235,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
