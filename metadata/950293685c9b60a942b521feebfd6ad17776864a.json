Winkler's version is set in New York and stars Robert De Niro as a shyster lawyer who decides to get even with a boxing promoter (Alan King) who bests him in court. A couple of innocents are talked into helping the cause, notably the brother (Jack Warden) of De Niro's enemy and a barmaid (Jessica Lange) who agrees to finance the operation. Everything goes south, plunging the hero into prospects of real disaster. The film is far from an exemplary, contemporary noir, but its outstanding cast, with no shortage of charisma and dynamics, keeps things terribly interesting. So does the funny but terse script by Richard Price (Clockers), who also has a cameo as a doctor. Winkler's sensibilities as a tasteful and intelligent producer still get in the way of his daring as a director, but he does leave us with much to be satisfied about.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105001/\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n\n========================================\n\nName.........: Night.and.the.City.1992.De.Niro.FZB\n\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 717,788 KB or 735,014,912 bytes)\n\nRuntime......: 01:38:36 (147,903 fr)\n\nVideo Codec..: XviD\n\nVideo Bitrate: 898 kb/s\n\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\n\nAudio Bitrate: 87 kb/s (43/ch, stereo) VBR \n\nFrame Size...: 576x432 (1.33:1) [=4:3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:950293685c9b60a942b521feebfd6ad17776864a","amp;dn":"Night.and.the.City.1992.De.Niro.FZB.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"950293685c9b60a942b521feebfd6ad17776864a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,2,147,104,92,155,96,169,66,181,33,254,235,253,106,209,119,118,134,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
