They emerged from Chicago in the early eighties, promoting themselves as &quot;White Metal&quot; in reference to their spiritual, somewhat religious lyrics (though they never aligned themselves with the Christian metal scene and are not really considered a religious band). They released a solid trio of albums on the Metal Blade label in the eighties before hooking up with Rick Rubin&amp;#039;s Def American label in 1990. Their six albums rank along the best bodies of work by any band -- truly doom masterpieces.\n\nFor many years after the release of their last album in 1995 came scattered reports that the band was on hiatus, inactive, or outright disbanded. Except for some members participating in other bands such as Lid and Supershine, little was heard from the band members themselves. Finally, in 2001, the band came back together, and in 2003 officially commenced work on a new album (originally titled Seven, eventually released as Simple Mind Condition in March 2007). \n\nReview by bnrmetal.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31fa5c9ea1be6fa89c5d293cfda7a266a136ffbb","amp;dn":"Trouble+-+Run+To+The+Light+%28%40192%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31fa5c9ea1be6fa89c5d293cfda7a266a136ffbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,250,92,158,161,190,111,168,156,93,41,60,253,167,162,102,161,54,255,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
