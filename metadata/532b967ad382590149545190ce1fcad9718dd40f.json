This will only work on PSP&amp;#039;s with custom firmware.\n\n\nThis has been fully tested on Firmware 3.71 M33 and 3.40 OE and works perfect.  It should work on older\ncustom firmware as well, but I have not personally tested it.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n1.   Unrar images (EBOOT.PBP)\n\n2.   Copy EBOOT.PBP to :\\PSP\\GAME     If it isn&amp;#039;t there, create the directory on your own.\n     (You may put it in a subfolder if you&amp;#039;d like.  e.g :\\PSP\\GAME\\FF9)\n\n3.   Copy KEYS.BIN into the same folder that you put EBOOT.PBP in.  \n     (I&amp;#039;ve had it work without this file, but you will probably need it. It&amp;#039;s not included. Try Google)\n\n3.   Boot your PSP and go to the &quot;Game&quot; folder and choose &quot;Memory Stick&quot;\n\n4.   (Optional)  If you would like to view the instruction manual in-came, copy DOCUMENT.DAT\n     to the same folder mentioned above.  Press the &quot;HOME&quot; button to access it.\n\n5.   (Not optional)  Rock out!\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\nKeep the same save file when you change disks.  The GameID is already setup.\n\n\n\nHLDS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532b967ad382590149545190ce1fcad9718dd40f","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+IX+%28PSX%29+fully+converted+to+PSP+format","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532b967ad382590149545190ce1fcad9718dd40f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,43,150,122,211,130,89,1,73,84,81,144,206,31,202,217,113,141,212,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
