One of the Shaw Brothers&amp;#039; key directors during the studio&amp;#039;s golden years, Kuei was a versatile filmmaker who dabbled in a range of genres, but his signature was undoubtedly gore, and usually of the extreme, stomach-turning variety. With infamous titles like Killer Snakes, Corpse Mania, and the Hex series, Kuei sealed his named into the top ranks of cult cinema. His elusive 1981 classic Bewitched, the precursor to its notorious 1983 sequel The Boxer&amp;#039;s Omen, is now finally available on DVD. \nA police officer (Melvin Wong) investigating the brutal murder of a young girl is shocked to discover that the culprit is the victim&amp;#039;s own father Lin (Ai Fei). Lin tells the police officer that he once encountered a woman who gave him a strange charm. From that day on, he suddenly became impotent, and his daughter developed a fondness for eating raw meat and attacking him. At the urging of an exorcist and driven by a strange power, he nails his daughter to death. Continuing to investigate the case, the police officer realizes that not only is Lin possessed, but he himself has also fallen under the bloody curse\nFormat               : AVI\nFormat/Info          : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family        : RIFF\nFile size            : 1.26 GiB\nPlayTime             : 102 mn\nBit rate             : 1764 Kbps\nVideo #0\nCodec                : DivX 4\nCodec/Family         : MPEG-4\nCodec settings/Matri : Default\nPlayTime             : 102 mn\nBit rate             : 1612 Kbps\nWidth                : 640 pixels\nHeight               : 360 pixels\nAspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate           : 29.970 fps\nResolution           : 8 bits\nChroma               : 4:2:0\nInterlacement        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.233\nAudio #Mandarin      Subtitles #English\nCodec                : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile        : Joint stereo\nPlayTime             :  102 mn\nBit rate             : 140 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : VBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a206f06155b4b472e2fff660f429c8e57fb2174","amp;dn":"Shaw+Bros.+Bewitched+remastered+w%2F+english+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a206f06155b4b472e2fff660f429c8e57fb2174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,32,111,6,21,91,75,71,46,47,255,102,15,66,156,142,87,251,33,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
