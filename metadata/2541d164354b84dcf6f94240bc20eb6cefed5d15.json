Mare, Pop and Gojko are three friends who grew up together. Mare and Pop have always been musicians, while Gojko (who was harassed by them in school and nicknamed 'Sissy') became a 'guy in suit', boss of his own club and recording studio. Pop and Mare call on their friend from school days to help them release the record, but all this doesn't go so smoothly. Gojko hasn't forgotten his school days and now he is surrounded by bodyguards. On their way to the club, Mare and Pop meet false Santa Claus, 'cool' cop and of course - girls.\n\nPreatty halarious movie, reminds me a lot of Korean's &quot;Attack The Gas Station&quot; and Beat's &quot;Getting Any&quot;.  Don't pay attention to IMDB's rating, I think this movie is way underrated, I'm sure u'll have a blast with this movie.\n\nSpoken Language: Serbo-Croation/Bosnian (Yugoslavia)\nSubs: English\n\n&quot;RESEED&quot;\n\nmELER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2541d164354b84dcf6f94240bc20eb6cefed5d15","amp;dn":"Dudes.aka.Thunderbirds.2001.DVDRip.XviD.Yugoslavia+-+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2541d164354b84dcf6f94240bc20eb6cefed5d15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,65,209,100,53,75,132,220,246,249,66,64,188,32,235,108,239,237,93,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
