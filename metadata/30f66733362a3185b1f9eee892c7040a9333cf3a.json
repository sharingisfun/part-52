Hired session musicians abound, intruding on that old band chemistry, but several songs actually hold up divorced from the big production and master concept, including &quot;Mother,&quot; &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; (with Gilmour's last great guitar solo) and the hard-rocking &quot;Run Like Hell.&quot; Also available: The Wall gold disc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30f66733362a3185b1f9eee892c7040a9333cf3a","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd-The+Wall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30f66733362a3185b1f9eee892c7040a9333cf3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,246,103,51,54,42,49,133,177,249,238,232,146,199,4,10,147,51,207,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
