The group formed in 1992, following a series of live \\&quot;jams\\&quot; (a DJ production crew) performed at the now defunct Bently Bar in Sydneys Darlinghurst area and has released five albums to date. Originally featuring reggae and hip hop, the group expanded their sound to incorporate elements of soul, jazz, latin, funk and breaks. They have been nominated for three ARIA Music Awards and an Australian Dance Music Award.\n\n\nTrack List:\n001 Be Humble\n002 Can\\&amp;#039;t Give you Up\n003 Church of Al Green\n004 Cookin\\&amp;#039; with Kazz\n005 Ear Logistix\n006 Everday Dub\n007 Frontier 69\n008 Genie of The Lab\n009 Hold Tight\n010 I Don\\&amp;#039;t Wana Know\n011 Stay With Me \\&amp;#039;Till Dawn\n012 You\\&amp;#039;re The Man\n\nPlease Seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb7116de9c87fe132c95469f1f2ba3e5bfbdbc7b","amp;dn":"Wicked+Beat+Sound+System+-+Inna+Styles+1999+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb7116de9c87fe132c95469f1f2ba3e5bfbdbc7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,113,22,222,156,135,254,19,44,149,70,159,31,43,163,229,191,189,188,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
