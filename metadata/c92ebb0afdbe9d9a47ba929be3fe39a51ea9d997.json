But as time passed and Evan has made up with Bruce, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s gone onto bigger and better things. Newly elected to Washington D.C. as a congressman, Evan has left Buffalo, New York in pursuit of a greater calling. But that calling isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t serving in the illustrious ranks of America\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s politics, but being summoned by the Almighty himself, who has handed Evan the task of building a new ark, much as Noah did before. With time passing by and his family belittled by Evan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s newfound realization, Evan will have to do the work that God has given him in what promises to be an unusual adventure for a man who just wanted to serve his country, might actually be serving humanity.\n\n\nIMBD:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0413099/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0413099/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c92ebb0afdbe9d9a47ba929be3fe39a51ea9d997","amp;dn":"evan+almighty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c92ebb0afdbe9d9a47ba929be3fe39a51ea9d997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,46,187,10,253,190,157,154,71,186,146,155,227,254,57,165,30,169,217,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
