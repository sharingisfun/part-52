I found the series to be really interesting because it forces you think of things from an other perspective than you are used to. Rudgley believes for instance that the heritage of the Pagan culture still effect people of northern Europe in a major way.\n\nThe term Pagan is from Latin paganus, an adjective originally meaning &quot;rural&quot;, &quot;rustic&quot; or &quot;of the country.&quot; As a noun, paganus was used to mean &quot;country dweller, villager.&quot; In colloquial use, it could mean much the same as calling someone today a &amp;#039;country bumpkin&amp;#039; or a &amp;#039;hillbilly&amp;#039;. Paganism is a term which, from a Western perspective, has come to connote a broad set of spiritual or cultic practices or beliefs of any folk religion, and of historical and contemporary polytheistic religions in particular. The term can be defined broadly, to encompass the faith traditions outside the Abrahamic monotheistic group of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nSoruce: Wikipedia\n\nBefore Roman culture and Christianity arrives in Northern Europe, including places that are now known as France, Germany, Great Britain, the Baltic states and Scandinavia, the people who lived there where by definition all Pagans believing in Pagan religions with Pagan culture. In other words, from the perspective of the Christians we were all Hillbillies who lived here in northern Europe. The Vikings in the far north was among the last people who converted to Christianity in Europe. When groups of people convert to another belief system and an other religion. That never comes easily. Think about it in terms of yourself converting from Christianity to Islam or the other way around for instance.\n\nOne of the main reasons of the bad reputation of the Pagans and their culture and religions is in fact the product of Christian propaganda over the decays. Through history and prehistory, the representations of the ancient gods and traditions followed by pagans have been marred by propaganda from other religious groups eager to rein in those they defined as wild barbarians.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Author/Presenter - Richard Rudgley\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRichard Rudgely is an Oxford-trained anthropologist and critically acclaimed author of &quot;Lost Civilisations of the Stone Age&quot; Also winner of the Prometheus Award, British Museum.

Dessutom som jag skrev hÃƒÂ¤r ovan ÃƒÂ¤r det en dramatisk fÃƒÂ¶rÃƒÂ¤ndring i mÃƒÂ¤nniskors liv att gÃƒÂ¥ frÃƒÂ¥n en religion till en annan, frÃƒÂ¥n en kultur till en annan, frÃƒÂ¥n ett trossystem till ett annat. Till exempel ÃƒÂ¤r ofta mÃƒÂ¤nniskor av annan religion/kultur sedda som man inom psykologin kallar fÃƒÂ¶r en utgrupp. Detta kan ha lett till att vikingar till de kristnas fÃƒÂ¶rvÃƒÂ¥nade fasa inte tÃƒÂ¤nkte tvÃƒÂ¥ gÃƒÂ¥nger innan de rÃƒÂ¥nade kyrkor och dÃƒÂ¶dade prÃƒÂ¤ster dÃƒÂ¤r det dessutom genom kristendomens effektiva skattesystem (tionde) samlats en hel del skatter. FÃƒÂ¶rutom det var det mest prÃƒÂ¤ster och kyrkfolk som skrev historien, eller som ÃƒÂ¶ver huvudtaget skrev nÃƒÂ¥got pÃƒÂ¥ den hÃƒÂ¤r tiden. Vi hÃƒÂ¤r i norden har behÃƒÂ¥llit en hel del av vÃƒÂ¥rt pagan-arv i och med till exempel vÃƒÂ¥rt heliga midsommarfirande dÃƒÂ¤r midsommarstÃƒÂ¥ngen ju till och med likar en fallossymbol som befruktar moderjord.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Pagans 3 of 4 Band of Brothers\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to Roman records, the Iron Age Celtic peoples of Britain consisted of war-like tribes ? but this could well be propaganda of the age. In 43 AD, as now, invaders found ways of justifying their subjugation of the native people whose country they colonised and whose land they took. Whatever the reality, the image of rough, heavy-drinking hooligans and evil barbarians is what we have been left with. \n\nPagan society in the Iron Age was certainly based on a strong system of tribal groups controlling different parts of the country, each with its own warrior class. However the accusations of barbarism could equally be a stereotyped reaction against these `uncivilised` cultures. \n\nThe truth is that, though bands of fighting men may well have dominated much of society, the basis of a proto-democracy was also in action. Community leaders had to demonstrate that they were worthy of the role, and some needed to canvass support from surrounding groups to hold power. The economy relied heavily on well-established trade routes and, for the pagan Britons of the time, the system worked fine before the Empire stepped in. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther torrents related to my favorite subject; humans and human behaviour:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:300440bbcd250c8468666d190bd67f9fde3c568c","amp;dn":"Channel+4+-+Pagans+3+of+4+Band+of+Brothers+-+Richard+Rudgley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"300440bbcd250c8468666d190bd67f9fde3c568c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,4,64,187,205,37,12,132,104,102,109,25,11,214,127,159,222,60,86,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
