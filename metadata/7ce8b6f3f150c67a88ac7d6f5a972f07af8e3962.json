With several million records sold world wide, Korn have completely reconstructed the metal sound into a hard-hitting, uncomromising catapult that many bands imitate, but will never duplicate. The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Korn severs the imitations and delivers a brand new interpretation of the music of Korn, intense tracks like &quot;Wake up&quot; and &quot;It&amp;#039;s on&quot; capture the anger and resentment of Korn, while tracks like &quot;Reclaim My Place&quot; and &quot;Falling Away From Me&quot; display the bands melancholy and despair, not to mention the original Korn-inspired track &quot;Gone&quot; by Motor Industries. A definite must for Korn fans everywhere. The whisper has become a deafening roar-&quot;Are You Ready?&quot;\n\n\nSongs:\n1  &quot;Dead Bodies Everywhere&quot; Motor Industries\n2  &quot;Wake Up&quot; Rex Havoc\n3  &quot;Freak On A Leash&quot; Bug Funny Foundation\n4  &quot;It?s On&quot; Motor Industries\n5  &quot;Blind&quot; Rex Havoc\n6  &quot;Reclaim My Place&quot; Bug Funny Foundation\n7  &quot;Let?s Get This Party Started&quot; Dogooder\n8  &quot;Falling Away From Me&quot; Dogooder\n9  &quot;Got The Life&quot; Bug Funny Foundation\n10  &quot;Gone&quot; Motor Industries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce8b6f3f150c67a88ac7d6f5a972f07af8e3962","amp;dn":"The+Electro-Industrial+Tribute+to+Korn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce8b6f3f150c67a88ac7d6f5a972f07af8e3962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,232,182,243,241,80,198,122,136,172,125,111,90,151,47,7,175,142,57,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
