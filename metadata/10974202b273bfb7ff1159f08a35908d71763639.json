I don&amp;#039;t know.\n\nTaiwanese rock and roll.  Pretty popular.  Been around a fairly long time.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s considered to be &quot;rock&quot;, \n-but IMHO it&amp;#039;s stereotypical, bland Chinese rock.  \n-It&amp;#039;s not bad, but I prefer music with a little harder edge to it (or hippie noodling or booty-shaking funk).\n-I figured I&amp;#039;d put it up just in case you might like it\n\nTo be honest, I can&amp;#039;t figure out exactly what album(s) this/these is/are.  \n-I tried to find the details for you all, but in my limited searching, I couldn&amp;#039;t.\n-Song #1 has an English title, so I labeled the file appropriately.\n-Song #7 has a video that I found on the internet, so I labeled that one with the Chinese title.\n--You can see the video here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://music.sina.com.cn/yueku/v/294726.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://music.sina.com.cn/yueku/v/294726.html&lt;/a&gt;\n--title is:  ?????? = ni shi ni wo shi wo = You are You, I am Me\n\nIf you really want me to post the other CD, just ask, and I will.  And/Or, If you seriously need a chinese language \n\ntrack list, I suppose I could do that for you.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the files:\n\n-Nothing fancy:  CD -&gt; Foobar -&gt; VBR -&gt; MP3\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nComments/Thanks:\n\nLike anyone else, I appreciate comments, but they aren&amp;#039;t really necessary.\n\nThe best way you can thank me is by pointing me to, or creating torrents of, \n\t1.  Language\n\t2.  Philosophy\n\t3.  History\n\t4.  Good Jam Band Music (Live and Lossless for the win!!)\n\t5.  Other Helpful Stuff\n\nSecond best way you can thank me, is by downloading and seeding.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd, of course...\n\nSince this artist IS available world-wide...\n\nIf you like it, buy it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10974202b273bfb7ff1159f08a35908d71763639","amp;dn":"%5BChinese+Language%5D%5BMusic%5D+Dick+and+Cowboy+-+%28album+title+unknown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10974202b273bfb7ff1159f08a35908d71763639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,151,66,2,178,115,191,183,255,17,89,240,138,53,144,141,113,118,54,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
