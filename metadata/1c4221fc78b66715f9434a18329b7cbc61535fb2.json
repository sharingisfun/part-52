It&amp;#039;s going to \nstraighten a lot of people out (laughs). There&amp;#039;s another album to come from the \nExperience...title Little Band Of Gypsys. It&amp;#039;s a jam type album.&amp;#039; Jimi had plans to \nproduce a quick `jam album&amp;#039; to pay off part of the settlement stemming from the \nnagging lawsuit.\n\nIn Hollywood in late March he told a reporter `We have to go to New York to record \nfrom the first to the seventh and get our new LP and single together.&amp;#039; Asked what the \ntitle was, Jimi answered `Freedom or Both Ways. The LP will probably be called \nFreedom, or either Band Of Gypsys, and the single is Freedom.&amp;#039;\n\nMid-way through the final Experience tour spring 1969, Jimi reached Charleston and \ntold the Gazette, `We&amp;#039;re bored with the Experience. We&amp;#039;ve got to do some of our own \nthings. That could include everything from acoustical guitar to the Mormon \nTabernacle Choir. We&amp;#039;re not sure what the title will be, but I think we&amp;#039;ll call it The \nEnd Of The Beginning. Music is stronger that politics. I think the answer lies in \nmusic.&amp;#039;\n\nIn Toronto for arraignment on possession charges in June, Jimi told the Globe and \nMail, `My next album, coming out in late summer, will be called Shine On Earth, \nShine On, or Gypsy Sun. The Christmas album will be called First Rays Of The New \nRising Sun. There Might be also a couple of other albums in between. A live `Albert \nHall&amp;#039; album which we cut in London and a greatest hits thing. But I have no control \nover them...We have about fourty songs in the works, about half of them complete. \nA lot of it comprises jams - all spiritual stuff, very earthy.&amp;#039;\n\nThis collection uses Jimi HendrixÃƒÂ¢??s original handwritten track lists for sides \nA to C  (Disc 1). Side D (on Disc 2) is compiled with most possible contenders, \nUnfortunately, Jimi&amp;#039;s passing meant that his concept remaines unfinished so \npossible side D and a few more unfinished tracks are all  included on Disc Two. \n\nOriginal Concept by Jimi Hendrix. \nAssembled by PDS. \nArtwork by Jellycat\n\n&quot;Pirate Bay&quot;, December 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4221fc78b66715f9434a18329b7cbc61535fb2","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+First+Rys+of+the+New+Rising+Sun+%28Collector","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4221fc78b66715f9434a18329b7cbc61535fb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,66,33,252,120,182,103,21,249,67,74,24,50,155,124,188,97,83,95,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
