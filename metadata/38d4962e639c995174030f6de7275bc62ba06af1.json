Connery - Cage are a great couple. Too bad there never was a part 2. But as I watched the movie again and again, the annoying things about it became more and more obvious, which made me hardly enjoy the movie anymore. Lame jokes, most of the time by people which are unimportant for the plot, and way over the top scenes, which became so embarrassing, spoiled the fun. So I decided that something needed to be done, to make this the movie I could watch over and over again, and I think I succeeded 100%. This fanedit is not so much shorter than the original, but the number of cuts is immense. Hopefully you won&amp;#039;t realize a single one of them.\n\n***************************THE EDIT**************************************\nPlenty of scenes were altered, too much to mention, but most of all these 5 scenes were really changed or even completely deleted:\n1. The stylist scenes: I reduced his gay behaviour and a lot of flat jokes that came with it. He still seems gay and special, but his appearance is a lot shorter and will not leave much of an impression.\n2. The Cable Car scene: What I did is, I deleted the cable car owner form the movie. His acting is so over the top and he is just not funny, but he spoils a cool car chase action scene.\n3. Stanley goes to vomit scene: Well, he still does, but this scene is much shorter. What was supposed to be funny, was not so much. Now he is more of a man.\n4. The Rollecoaster Mourge Ride scene: The entire scene was unrealistic to the max, so I tried to reduce the size of the cave and get rid of the wagon drive scenes. It worked pretty well.\n5. The thermite plasma explosion: Thermite plasma is not your usual bomb or explosive. It is hot like hell and causes a HUGE explosion. And because Stan could never survive to be blown away by that, I changed that, so now he escapes the explosion. I am very proud of this editing work.\n***************************DVD DETAILS************************************\n125 minutes NTSC 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with AC3-5.1 audio and a vbr of 4.000KB/s using a 3 pass encoding with CCE.\nLANGUAGES         : ENGLISH, GERMAN, SPANISH, RUSSIAN\nSUBTITLES         : ENGLISH, SWEDISH\nMENUS             : most are animated with sound\nSCENE SELECTION   : yes\nTRAILER, TEASER   : no\nDELETED SCENES    : yes, an all in one 12 minutes deleted scenes mix\nCOMMENTARY        : yes, for the 12-minutes deleted scenes mix\nCBB OVERVIEW      : yes, for all 21 fanedits\nSPECIAL FEATURE   : FE Quizshow\nCOVER&amp;Disc ART    : yes, on DVD-Rom part\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ABOUT FANEDITS+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nA fan edit is a version of a film modified by a viewer, that removes, reorders, or adds material in order to create a new interpretation of the film. This includes the removal of scenes or dialog, replacement of audio and/or visual elements, and adding material from sources such as deleted scenes or even other films. \nNow lots of people are complaining the original might take damage, when a different cut is released, but the original is still there, unchanged and no one is forced to watch a fan edit. It is like painting a moustache to a postcard of the Mona Lisa (quote taken from Mike Nichols commentary of THE PHANTOM EDIT). No harm done. No harm intended.\nAs for myself: I respect the companies and the artists involved in these projects. They did the work. But when a work of art is published it finally belongs to the public and I should be as allowed to edit a movie to my liking than I am to make my own collection of hits on a CD.\nThose movies are not created to replace the original, they represent just an alternate view. Fan edits cannot be bought or sold, the material is copyrighted and belongs to the original owners. To legally watch them, you need to own the original DVDs.
