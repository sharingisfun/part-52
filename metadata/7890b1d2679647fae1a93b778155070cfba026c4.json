Finally, here's book 3 in the series.  With a better bit rate.\n\nFrom Amazon:\nIn this third installment to Eoin Colfer's funny, fast-paced, fairy-filled adventure series, boy genius and arch criminal Artemis Fowl once again can't resist plotting the perfect crime--and, once again, he can't keep from stirring up so much trouble that the fate of the entire fairy world teeters in the balance. \nThe once hard-boiled Artemis has softened a bit between his bestselling debut and the seat-of-your-pants Arctic Incident, and that trend continues in The Eternity Code: He's still plotting for a billion-dollar-plus payoff for the Fowl family, but now his enemies are human (chiefly Jon Spiro, a ruthless businessman Artemis tries to blackmail using stolen fairy technology) and he has to turn to his old adversary-turned-friend Captain Holly Short and cutpurse dwarf Mulch Diggums for help. The dialogue and action prove as smart and page-turning as ever this time around, with Artemis struggling to bring his faithful bodyguard Butler back from the dead before racing Mission Impossible-style to triple-cross the double-crossing Spiro. \n\nColfer's young antihero might be getting more likeable all the time, but that hasn't taken the edge off the Tom-Clancy-meets-Harry-Potter action. Artemis has to agree to a memory-erasing &quot;mind wipe&quot; from the People after helping them recover their technology, but only a foolish fan would count Artemis out after this blockbuster &quot;final heist.&quot; Book four can't come soon enough.... (Ages 9 to 12) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7890b1d2679647fae1a93b778155070cfba026c4","amp;dn":"Eoin+Colfer+-+The+Eternity+Code+-+Artemis+Fowl+Book+3+%28128kbps%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7890b1d2679647fae1a93b778155070cfba026c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,144,177,210,103,150,71,250,225,169,59,119,129,85,7,12,251,160,38,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
