I recieved some criticism on my Year Zero compilation. Despite that I decided to do another of The Downward Spiral. These are my favorite fan mixed tracks. As always the ID3 tags are edited to I hope perfection and it comes with cover art. The tracks are positioned to flow nicely.\n\tI will be making compilations of all the NIN albums if there are sufficient remixes of the songs of the albums. I also have a few other projects being put together right now such as a rarities compilation and a mashup of Year Zero.\n\t\t\nFarewell: Hope you enjoy. This is the Seventh release. \n\nCredits to: Everyone who was behind making these tracks. To the unkown girl taking a picture of Jesus on her trip to Italy. As always if you have had any hand in creating these tracks please come forward so credit can be given.\n\nReleases:\n1_Guns N&amp;#039; Roses - Appetite for Democracy\n2_Metallica - &quot;The New Album&quot; (Live Bootlegs)\n3_Nine Inch Nails - Holding_On\n4_Trent Reznor/Peter Murphy - Radioshows\n5_Red Hot Chili Peppers - Stadium Arcadium: Venus (B-Sides Compilation)\n6_Nine Inch Nails - Y34RZ3R0F4NR3M1X3D\n7_Nine Inch Nails - The Inevitable Crash\n\nstems_:\nstem01_Trent Reznor/Peter Murphy: Radioshows\nstem02_Holding_On\nstem03_Y34RZ3R0F4NR3M1X3D\nstem04_The Inevitable Crash\n\nstems is the gay way i have decided to order my Nine Inch Nails releases/compilations... so, yeah.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b24f2f94f7d1994bc4dd6d3a428f197ce077f9ff","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+The+Inevitable+Crash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b24f2f94f7d1994bc4dd6d3a428f197ce077f9ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,79,47,148,247,209,153,75,196,221,109,58,66,143,25,124,224,119,249,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
