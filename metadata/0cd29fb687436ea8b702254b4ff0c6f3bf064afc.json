So here it is. ^_^\n\n\nLucky Leif and the Longships is a concept album dealing with how american culture might have been different had the vikings managed to colonise the continent. The album is a tour through various styles of American music, filled with references to modern American culture and ancient Norse myths and legends. Brian Eno produced it. Imho this is not as good as his Captain Lockheed and the starfighers album (which could have something to do with me beeing a diehard Lemmy fan), but still a very good and fun one. Anyone making a beach boys pastiche about vikings surfing the usa substituting &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; with &quot;Barbarians&quot; get my thumbs up :D\n\n\n224Vbr\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 1.
