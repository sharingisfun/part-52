All images are 16.9 aspect ratios. This is a fabulous collection of some of the best photographs for a screensaver.I only downloaded three categories all relating to nature, outdoor and city scape scenes. Also included is Webshots Desktop screensaver software (freeware), which has to be installed prior to using the WB1 photos. If you don&amp;#039;t want to install Webshots Desktop, then you can convert the WB1 files to JPG with the included Ultimate Webshots Converter software (freeware). The Nature &amp; Travel scenes are mostly the same types of photos, beautiful outdoor themes. The Flowers and Gardens collection is more suited for mom &amp; grandma&amp;#039;s! When installing Webshots Desktop, be sure not to install the IE toolbar for Webshots. Go to Webshots.com and look under the Pro Shots tab to see what is included.\n\nIf you were to set Webshots Desktop to change your desktop wallpaper once per day with all of the included photos, it would take you 10.6 years to see all of the photos!\n\n\n\nNATURE SCENES 1228 photos\nBeaches\nCanyons\nClouds\nDeserts\nFall Colors\nForests\nGrand Canyon\nGreat Smoky Mountains\nLakes\nMountains\nNational Parks\nOceans\nRivers and Creeks\nRocks\nSun and Sky\nSunrises\nSunsets\nTrees\nVolcanoes\nWaterfalls\nWinter Scenes\nYosemite\n\nTRAVEL 2074 photos\nAfrica\nAlaska\nAntarctica\nArizona\nAsia\nAustralia\nAustria\nBridges\nCalifornia\nCanada\nCaribbean\nCastles\nCentral America\nChina\nCityscapes\nColorado\nEgypt\nEngland\nEurope\nFamous Landmarks\nFarms and Barns\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nHawaii\nIreland\nIslands\nItaly\nJapan\nLighthouses\nMexico\nMiddle East\nMills\nMontana\nNevada\nNew England\nNew York\nNew Zealand\nOregon\nPortugal\nRoads\nScotland\nSlovenia\nSouth America\nSpain\nSwitzerland\nTennessee\nThailand\nTropical Paradise\nUnited States\nUtah\nWashington\nWashington, DC\nWindmills\n\nFLOWERS &amp; GARDENS 572 photos\nDaisies\nFields\nFlower Close-Ups\nFlower Mix\nGardens\nLilies\nOrchids\nPoppies\nRoses\nSunflowers\nTulips\nWildflowers\n\nInstall directions:\n\nInstall Webshots Desktop (be sure not to select the IE toolbar option).
