Does he still feel bitter and responsible for the air crash in March 1975 which claimed the lives of his wife and daughter? \n\nWhy wasn&amp;#039;t he happy at receiving his Knighthood from the Queen? and; if it was possible, would he do anything different if the clocks could be turned back?\n\nFile: HARDtalk - Sir Edmund Hillary (BBCNews24, 11 January 2008) [TVrip Xvid].avi\nFilesize: 200.76 Mb ( 210,515,854 bytes )\nPlay length: 00:25:59.479 (38987 frames)\nSubtitles: Not Present\nVideo: 720x576 (1.25:1), 25 fps, DivX Codec 4.x ~1066 kbps avg, 0.10 bit/pixel\nAudio: 48 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~128.00 kbps avg\n\nEx-Esclad thebox.bz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc60e5760ed66cd1f8fa1e83b410c041cee1334d","amp;dn":"HARDtalk+-+Sir+Edmund+Hillary+%28BBCNews24%2C+11+January+2008%29+%5BTVri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc60e5760ed66cd1f8fa1e83b410c041cee1334d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,96,229,118,14,214,108,209,248,250,30,131,180,16,192,65,206,225,51,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
