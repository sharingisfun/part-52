The series won the R.A.C. Squiddy Award for Best Limited Comic Series in 1999 as well as the CBG Award for Favorite Limited Series in 2000.\n\nThe story revolves around the &quot;Destiny War&quot;, a time travel-based conflict between Kang the Conqueror and his future self, Immortus. Notably, the story effectively comes to a complete halt in issues #7 and #8, as Busiek uses these issues to iron out the many wrinkles in Avengers history and clarify the history of Kang in explicit, flashback-filled detail, in turn undoing much of the poorly-received Avengers: The Crossing crossover from a few years prior.\n\n\nYou can find Avengers The Crossing Crossover here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4002488/Avengers_The_Crossing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4002488/Avengers_The_Crossing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa4e8b86a20089cd9dfe109a573639249a254934","amp;dn":"Avengers+Forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa4e8b86a20089cd9dfe109a573639249a254934","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,78,139,134,162,0,137,205,157,254,16,154,87,54,57,36,154,37,73,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
