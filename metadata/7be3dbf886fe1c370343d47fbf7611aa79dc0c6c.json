After doing time in hard-core Sing-Sing for petty thefts and drug dealing, Pinero&amp;#039;s prison experiences developed into the 1974 Tony-nominated play Short Eyes. The resulting notoriety and fame was too much for the Latino bad-boy genius who retreated to the darker corners of New York City.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7be3dbf886fe1c370343d47fbf7611aa79dc0c6c","amp;dn":"Pinero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7be3dbf886fe1c370343d47fbf7611aa79dc0c6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,227,219,248,134,254,28,55,3,67,212,127,191,118,17,170,121,220,12,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
