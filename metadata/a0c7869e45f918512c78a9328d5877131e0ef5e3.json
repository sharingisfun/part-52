About 6-7 minutes longer, this reintegrates most of the deleted, extended or alternate material. This helps strengthen the relationship between Will Graham and his son (which in turn makes the climax all the more powerful), shows us more of Will GrahamÃƒÂ¢??s analytic mind, DolarhydeÃƒÂ¢??s madness (including the excised ÃƒÂ¢??Red Dragon VoiceoverÃƒÂ¢?? by Frank Langella), Dr. ChiltonÃƒÂ¢??s tactlessness, and snips out Lloyd BowmanÃƒÂ¢??s reading of the decoded message to heighten the tension of what it might say as Will waits to hear it.\n\nI personally liked this film. While itÃƒÂ¢??s not nearly as great as Silence, I give props to Ratner for at least trying to capture that filmÃƒÂ¢??s mood. So once again pull up a chair to the dining table and enjoy this last soiree with Anthony Hopkins in the role that made him a household name.\n\nTime needed for the edition: \n\n3 days \npersons involved: ADigitalMan\n\nIMAGES:\ncover art by ADigitalMan:\n\nWWW.FANEDIT.ORG\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c7869e45f918512c78a9328d5877131e0ef5e3","amp;dn":"Red+Dragon%3A+Desserts+Served+With+Your+Main+Course","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c7869e45f918512c78a9328d5877131e0ef5e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,199,134,158,69,249,24,81,44,120,169,50,141,88,119,19,30,14,245,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
