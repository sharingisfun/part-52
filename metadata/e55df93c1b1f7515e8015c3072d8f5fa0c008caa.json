Six rebels on the run. An assassin in pursuit. When the renegade crew of Serenity agrees to hide a fugitive on their ship, they find themselves in an action-packed battle between the relentless military might of a totalitarian regime who will destroy anything - or anyone - to get the girl back and the bloodthirsty creatures who roam the uncharted areas of space. But, the greatest danger of all may be on their ship. From the mind of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel) comes a new edge-of-your-seat adventure loaded with explosive battles, gripping special effects and fantastic new worlds.\n***SERENITY\n***DVDRIP\n***XVID\n***English\n***A rACECAr rip\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55df93c1b1f7515e8015c3072d8f5fa0c008caa","amp;dn":"SERENITY.DVDRIP.XVID.Eng.rACECAr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55df93c1b1f7515e8015c3072d8f5fa0c008caa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,93,249,60,27,31,117,21,232,1,92,48,114,216,245,250,12,0,140,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
