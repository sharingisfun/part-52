SPL offers a clear example of genuine effort and talent in the writing, acting, and action. It&amp;#039;s definitely a crime-drama first, and a martial arts film last, but the quality is undeniable. \n\nAvg. Rating:  4.5 / 5 (based on 31 ratings). What did you think of it?  \n\nPlot: Officer Ma (Donnie Yen) is a principled cop whose martial arts skills and reputation for violence introduce tension to his precinct. But the death of a cop who was planted undercover in crime boss Po&amp;#039;s (Sammo Hung) gang only further disrupts the balance. \n \nOverview: In this good-cop-versus-bad-gangster action thriller, Detective Chan (Simon Yam) relentlessly pursues crime boss Po (Sammo Hung), but eventually gives up in frustration and looks toward retirement. His replacement, Ma (Donnie Yen, &quot;Iron Monkey&quot;, &quot;Blade II&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot;), is a principled, committed cop who is skilled in martial arts and has a reputation for violence. The newcomer introduces tension into the established ranks of the battle-scarred precinct. The death of a cop who was planted undercover in Po&amp;#039;s gang further disrupts the balance of truth and justice. \n \nCast: Sammo Hung Kam-Bo  ||  Donnie Yen Ji-Dan  ||  Jacky Wu Jing  ||  Simon Yam Tat-Wah  ||  Liu Kai-Chi  ||  Kenji Tanigaki  ||  Timmy Hung Tin-Ming  ||  Ken Cheung Chi-Yiu  ||  Uncle Ba Suk  ||  Austin Wai Tin-Chi  ||  Ha Shiu-Sing  ||  Vincent Sze  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.538573/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.538573/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
