The purpose of this edit was to create more of a traditional Friday The 13th film using the shot footage. This is the first part of two. I will be releasing \\&quot;Friday The 13th X: Jason Takes Freddy\\&quot; in about two weeks.\n\nHow This Edit Plays:\n\nThe film still opens with the girl getting attacked, but instead of the SWAT Team appearing, she is killed. (ROLL CREDITS)\nWe then fade to Steven driving in his car. He picks up the hitchhikers and takes them to camp. They have sex and are all slaughtered. The next evening Steven arrives to his original destination - The Voorhees House. There, he finds dusty furniture, loose floorboards and the book of the dead. Suddenly, Jason busts through the floor. Steven, ready to fight, charges at him and they both come crashing out of the window. Jason nearly beats him to death before the SWAT Team appears and blows him to smithereens. Yes, it was a trap...however, it\\&amp;#039;s too good to be true. Suddenly Freddy Krueger reaches up out of the ground and snatches Jason\\&amp;#039;s hockey mask - pulling back down to the bowels of hell. \\&quot;TO BE CONTINUED\\&quot;\n\nENJOY AND SEED! \n\nFULL DVD! Film runs 21 minutes and the DVD includes a trailer.\n\nFrom Your Friends At RETRO HORROR REMIX!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc9939b1983dd15cbc1b6213c734bdacab2a3d9","amp;dn":"%5BFAN+EDIT%5DFriday+The+13th+IX%3A+The+Final+Friday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc9939b1983dd15cbc1b6213c734bdacab2a3d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,201,147,155,25,131,221,21,203,193,182,33,60,115,75,218,202,178,163,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
