The songs don&amp;#039;t appear to move at all over\ntheir duration, but they are utterly seared in\nsurges of intensity, of lyrical oddities, of\nterrifying pulses and dark corners. It stems partly\nfrom the densely minimal arrangements of one-note\nguitars and drums that thud the side of your skull,\nbut it is mostly attributable to the entire\nfrostiness of the sound world. The gentle arpeggios\nof &amp;#039;St. Neil&amp;#039; are indicative of a veiled melodic\nsensibility reminiscent of, oddly enough,\nsemi-namesakes Low. The gorgeous bottlenecked\nguitar and cannily crafted strings in the\nbackground lend some lamenting lyricism to the\ndarkly languorous audio-dramatics we are privy to.\n\nWith that monumentally pretty song being followed\nby another similarly colourful and swelling jewel\nof a slow burn, &amp;#039;Wolves Eat Dogs&amp;#039;, one could easily\nmistake The Low Lows as the diseased,\nMorricone-influenced baby brothers of Low. But this\nwould be to miss the point entirely. Where the\nSparhawks have the pleading stance of wronged\ninnocents, P.L. Noon from The Low Lows knows\nexactly what is wrong. He just can&amp;#039;t do anything\nabout it. &quot;I never should have left the woods, I\nshould have known I never could have not hurt you?&quot;\nhe pitifully cries. It is Noon&amp;#039;s voice that carries\na large portion of &amp;#039;Fire On The Bright Sky&amp;#039;, such\nis the relative restraint of the arrangements below\nhim. And it is this restraint that allows the\nbarely-intelligible word to become unerringly\nprevalent. When he wails about &amp;#039;poor Georgia girls&amp;#039;\nit is difficult to know what he means, but\nthunderously easy to know that he means it.\n\nAs &amp;#039;Fire On The Bright Sky&amp;#039; relaxes around you, its\nluxuriant atmosphere caressing the surrounding air,\nit becomes utterly obvious that this is the work of\npeople who are well-versed in delicate\nconstructions and who know the value of waiting\nbefore giving a musical pay-off. The stop-start\nslapdash of &amp;#039;(No Such Thing As) Sarah Jane&amp;#039; is\nexpertly paced with an ending so impeccably woven\nthrough with viscous horns and strings that\nsatisfaction is not so much guaranteed as\ngospel-intoned. The pacing of the record as a whole\nis guilty of a monumental slow-down, but this does\nnothing to stifle the enjoyment. If anything, it is\na record that needs to slow down anyway. It isn&amp;#039;t\nhard to get comfortable with the gradual downward\nspiral that reaches its lowest ebb on the final\nspoken-word and organ bluster of &amp;#039;The Russian\nEnding&amp;#039;. The beauty is never not entirely at the\nforefront, with the dark ramblings of &amp;#039;Little by\nlittle we never met again&amp;#039; providing the necessary\ngravity to this most mournful of records.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89906e13c4f2a1bf5c48ee867edf9442e4371580","amp;dn":"The_Low_Lows-Shining_Violence-2008-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89906e13c4f2a1bf5c48ee867edf9442e4371580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,144,110,19,196,242,161,191,92,72,238,134,126,223,148,66,228,55,21,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
