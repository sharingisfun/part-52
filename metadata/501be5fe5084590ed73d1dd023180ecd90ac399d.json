Complex rhythms, percussive textures, and stirring melodies strike a rare balance between classical form and ambient atmospherics. Chambers 11-17 is a lush musical journey infused with a sense of traveling to other worlds, times, or cultures. The beat-driven soundscapes are hypnotic, and bring both a sense of peace and energy to those who listen. This is soulful, global music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501be5fe5084590ed73d1dd023180ecd90ac399d","amp;dn":"WingMakers+Music+--%3D%3D+CHAMBER+11-17+%3D%3D--+%28%2A.CCD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501be5fe5084590ed73d1dd023180ecd90ac399d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,27,229,254,80,132,89,14,215,61,29,208,35,24,14,205,144,172,57,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
