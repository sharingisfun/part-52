We pray the Supreme Court will reconsider this grievous decision that denies to the People a declaration of the full contours of the meaning of the last ten words of the First Amendment.\n\nDuring the coming days, this Foundation will announce what it believes are the appropriate next steps for the People to restore Constitutional Order and secure Freedom for ourselves, and our posterity.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bdfe171e403b10a26e83a4c8718e89e772d81af","amp;dn":"U.S.--Supreme+Court+rejects+1st+Amendment+right-to-petition+case","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bdfe171e403b10a26e83a4c8718e89e772d81af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,223,225,113,228,3,177,10,38,232,58,76,135,24,232,158,119,45,129,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
