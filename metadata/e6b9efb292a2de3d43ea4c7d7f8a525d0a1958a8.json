Quality is in no way DVD, a little blocky, but that\\&amp;#039;s from the source file. However, still watchable. \n\nSummary:\n\nStargate: The Ark of Truth is a planned direct-to-DVD movie that will be written and directed by \nRobert C. Cooper. The movie went into production in April 2007, and will be released in the US on \nMarch 11, 2008. The production budget was $7 million.\n\nThis movie will be the conclusion of Stargate SG-1\\&amp;#039;s Ori arc, which began in \\&quot;Avalon\\&quot;. The Ori storyline \nwas originally expected to continue into SG-1\\&amp;#039;s eleventh season, but the series was cancelled by the \nSci-Fi Channel in August 2006. Therefore, the movie\\&amp;#039;s storyline will pick up after \\&quot;Unending\\&quot;, the SG-1 \nseries finale, but will take place before Stargate Atlantis\\&amp;#039;s Season 4.\n\nPlot:\n\nThe movie will cover SG-1\\&amp;#039;s attempt to recover the \\&quot;Ark of Truth\\&quot;\n\nThe \\&quot;Ark of Truth\\&quot; is a piece of Alteran technology developed before the Ancients left for the Milky \nWay. In an attempt to prevent the Ori and their followers rising to power, a device was created that \ncould essentially \\&quot;brainwash\\&quot; individuals, for instance Priors, into believing whatever \\&quot;truth\\&quot; was \nprogrammed into the device. The Ancients\\&amp;#039; non-interference policy and belief in free will resulted in \nthe device never being used. Even though the promise of Ascension promised by Origin is a lie, the \nfreedom to believe was something the Alterans ultimately decided they did not have the right to restrict. \nSG-1 likewise faces the moral and ethical issues raised by the use of the device.\n\nCast:\n\n* Ben Browder as Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell\n* Michael Shanks as Dr. Daniel Jackson\n* Amanda Tapping as Col. Samantha Carter\n* Christopher Judge as Teal\\&amp;#039;c\n* Claudia Black as Vala Mal Doran\n* Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry\n* Tim Guinee as Tomin\n* Greg Anderson as Prior\n* Currie Graham as James Merek\n* Morena Baccarin as Adria\n* Sarah Strange as Morgan le Fay\n* Julian Sands as Doci\n\nRichard Dean Anderson will not return as Maj. Gen. Jack O\\&amp;#039;Neill, but he will appear in the next SG-1 \nmovie, Stargate: Continuum.\n\nSource: hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate:_The_Ark_of_Truth\n\nEncode info:\n\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family : RIFF\nFile size : 694 MiB\nPlayTime : 1h 42mn\nBit rate : 944 Kbps\n\nVideo #0\nCodec : Intel H.264\nCodec/Info : Intel H.264\nPlayTime : 1h 42mn\nBit rate : 803 Kbps\nWidth : 656 pixels\nHeight : 400 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 1.640\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.122\n\nAudio #0\nCodec : AC3\nPlayTime : 1h 42mn\nBit rate : 126 Kbps\nBit rate mode : CBR\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\nSampling rate : 44 KHz\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b9efb292a2de3d43ea4c7d7f8a525d0a1958a8","amp;dn":"Stargate+The+Ark+Of+Truth+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b9efb292a2de3d43ea4c7d7f8a525d0a1958a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,185,239,178,146,162,222,61,67,234,76,125,127,138,82,93,10,25,88,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
