The duo meet up with Lord Tenkai-sama, who recruits them to take out another trouble-rousing government official, the vengeful Masayuki Sanada. In order to protect himself, Sanada recruits a crack team of high tech assassins that Azumi must face in turn before taking on Sanada in a bruising final showdown.\n\nBoasting extravagant set pieces, sublime choreography and ns whose powers verge on the superhero, the key to ni 2 is still the towering performance of Aya Ueto, the late female action hero.\n\nCast: \tAya Ueto  ||  Yuma Ishigaki  ||  Chiaki Kuriyama  ||  Shun Oguri  ||  Kenichi Endo  ||  Kai Shishido  ||  Eugene Nomura  ||  Tak Sakaguchi  ||  Shoichiro Masumoto  ||  Kenji Takechi  ||  Ai Maeda  ||  Toshie Negishi  ||  Toshiya Nagasawa  ||  Shigeru Koyama  ||  Kazuki Kitamura \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
