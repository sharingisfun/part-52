Stephen King&amp;#039;s &quot;dark half&quot; may have saved the best for last.\n\n----\n\nA fellow named Richard Bachman wrote Blaze in 1973 on an Olivetti \ntypewriter, then turned the machine over to Stephen King, who used it to \nwrite Carrie. Bachman died in 1985 (&quot;cancer of the pseudonym&quot;), but in late \n2006 King found the original typescript of Blaze among his papers at the \nUniversity of Maine&amp;#039;s Fogler Library (&quot;How did this get here?!&quot;), &amp; decided \nthat with a little revision it ought to be published.\n\nBlaze is the story of Clayton Blaisdell, Jr.?of the crimes committed against \nhim &amp; the crimes he commits, including has last, the kidnapping of a baby heir \nworth millions. Blaze has been a slow thinker since childhood, when his father \nthrew him down the stairs?&amp; then threw him down again. After escaping an \nabusive institution for boys when he was a teenager, Blaze hooks up with \nGeorge, a seasoned criminal who thinks he has all the answers. But then \nGeorge is killed, &amp; Blaze, though haunted by his partner, is on his own.\n\nHe becomes one of the most sympathetic criminals in all of literature. This is a \ncrime story of surprising strength &amp; sadness, with a suspenseful current \nsustained by the classic workings of fate &amp; character?as taut &amp; riveting as \nStephen King&amp;#039;s The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.\n\n----\n\nIn his &quot;lifetime,&quot; Richard Bachman published five novels. A sixth, The \nRegulators, was published after he died of pseudonym cancer (a relatively \npainless way to go) in 1985. He developed a cult following both before &amp; \nafter his death. Two of his novels (Thinner &amp; The Running Man) were made \ninto motion pictures. This novel?both brutal &amp; sensitive?is his final legacy.\n\n----\n\nRon McLarty has appeared on Broadway in That championship Season, Our \nCountry&amp;#039;s Good, &amp; Moonchildren. His film credits include Two Bits, The \nPostman, &amp; The Flamingo Kid. On television he starred in Spenser for Hire &amp; \nCop Rock. Mr. McLarty is an award winning playwright &amp; the author of the \nacclaimed novel The Memory of Running.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6fa918d9c33f0dd2d326f32251d18aee709ac4d","amp;dn":"Richard+Bachman+-+Blaze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6fa918d9c33f0dd2d326f32251d18aee709ac4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,250,145,141,156,51,240,221,45,50,111,50,37,29,24,174,231,9,172,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
