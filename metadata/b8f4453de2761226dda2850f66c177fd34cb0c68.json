Although Witness has said he \\&quot;started making hip-hop music at age 15 with intentions of waking up the next day and becoming Kool Moe Dee,\\&quot; he has abandoned (for the most part) the traditional rap game for an indie take on the hip-hop genre. His latest EP, Evermore, uses cellos, acoustic guitar and jazz undertones for a beat production that lands somewhere between Buck 65 and DJ Shadow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f4453de2761226dda2850f66c177fd34cb0c68","amp;dn":"Witness-The+Evermore+EP.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f4453de2761226dda2850f66c177fd34cb0c68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,244,69,61,226,118,18,38,221,162,133,15,102,193,119,253,52,203,12,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
