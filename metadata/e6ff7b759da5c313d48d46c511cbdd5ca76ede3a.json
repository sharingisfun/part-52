Lustmord at Scientific Electric, Los Angeles, March-August 1994. Many of the sounds on &quot;Trans Plutonian Transmissions&quot; are derived from cosmological activity as recorded by NASA&amp;#039;s deep space network.\n\n&quot;Under the pseudonym Arecibo, Brian Lustmord [sic] made &quot;Trans plutonian transmissions&quot;, an album that uses cosmic sounds (like pulsars, quasars, thermal radiation, electron partical interaction and even the remains of supernova explosions) as pirmal source and creates music that seems to come from light years away and is, on certain moments, as dark and old as the universe itself.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ff7b759da5c313d48d46c511cbdd5ca76ede3a","amp;dn":"Arecibo+-+Trans+Plutonian+Transmissions+%28hirate+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ff7b759da5c313d48d46c511cbdd5ca76ede3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,255,123,117,157,165,195,19,212,141,70,197,17,203,221,92,167,110,222,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
