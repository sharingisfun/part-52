Here is a list of the movies: \n\nDisc 1: Casablanca Express (1989), Cold War Killers (1986), A Yank in Libya (1942), Waterfront (1944), \n\nDisc 2: Commandos (1968), Eagles Attack at Dawn (1970), Hitler&amp;#039;s SS - Portrait of Evil (1985 - the best movie in the pack in my opinion), Go For Broke (1951), \n\nDisc 3: North Star (1943), Submarine Base (1943), Gung Ho! (1943), The Sell Out (1976), \n\nDisc 4: Black Brigade (1970), Half-Shot At Sunrise (1930), They Raid by Night (1942), Five For Hell (1968).\n\nNot all of the movies are worth seeing - the worst of the bunch are Casablanca Express &amp; Five For Hell. The best at Hitler&amp;#039;s SS and Gung Ho!. Several of the period WWII film&amp;#039;s are very interesting just to see what Hollywood was putting out during the war years.\n\nDisc 5: No substitute for victory (documentary).
