There is, after all, so much that could be done with Hawkwind&amp;#039;s back catalog, beginning with a box set that delves deeper into the period archive -- with many of this set&amp;#039;s prime rarities having already surfaced on the expanded versions of the original LPs, the need for a mere single disc&amp;#039;s worth of odds-and-ends was minimal, to say the least. All of that notwithstanding, of course, the sheer quality of the music on Stasis remains unimpeachable. &quot;Silver Machine,&quot; &quot;Urban Guerilla,&quot; and &quot;Psychedelic Warlords,&quot; the band&amp;#039;s most successful U.K. singles of the age, all stand proud among the all-time Hawkwind classics, while the live material readily captures the intent, if not the entire mood, of the Space Ritual. The B side &quot;Seven By Seven&quot; is a genuinely atmospheric jewel, and only the absence of &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; truly derails this set&amp;#039;s claim to be a genuine best-of Hawkwind&amp;#039;s early years.
