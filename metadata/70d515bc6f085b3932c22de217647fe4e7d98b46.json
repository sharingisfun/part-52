Originally filmed on 35mm, the footage comes alive on DVD resulting in a visually stunning film that far outstrips the usual live video of the 80&amp;#039;s. The disc carries two sound options - the original concert audio specially mixed into 5.1 Surround Sound by Kevin Shirley, Maiden&amp;#039;s producer since 1999, plus the original stereo sound track by Martin Birch, the band&amp;#039;s producer from 1981 to 1993. Originally released on video in 1985, this has been largely unavailable for the past 20 years\n\nDisc two has Part 2 of the &amp;#039;History of Iron Maiden&amp;#039; documentary, continuing the Maiden story from &amp;#039;The Early Days&amp;#039; DVD, along with rare and unseen bonus footage in the form of Behind The Iron Curtain, Rock In Rio &amp;#039;85, and `Ello Texas, giving a total running time of well over three hours. Plus of course the photo galleries, relevant promo videos, artwork galleries, tour dates, tour programme and other features which all combine to make Maiden DVDs a very special and utterly comprehensive treat for their fans.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
