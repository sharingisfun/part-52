This is an investigative road movie about two overachieving directors, a prophet\\\\\\&amp;#039;s great-granddaughter, and a CIA agent. A detective-like quest after the Bahai religion, which originated in Iran some 150 years ago, and ended up building its world centre on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel.\n\nAsaf grew up next to the beautiful Bahai gardens, staring out of his bedroom window when the Bahais excavated the entire Mount Carmel and built a secret underground city. He shared his thoughts and fears with Naama. They join forces to try and find out what lies beneath the Bahai Gardens - and document it cinematically. The directors\\\\\\&amp;#039; mission begins in their backyard, using their un-polished detective skills to garner as much information about the underground city as possible. They make numerous trips to the Bahai gardens as \\\\\\&quot;tourists\\\\\\&quot;, trying to find loop holes which will gain them access them to the floors below. They meet people who have worked for the Bahai under ground, and who are willing to anonymously reveal what lies beneath.\n\nThe story turns international, when the two directors follow a worldwide espionage affair. Dr. David Kelly, the MI6 agent - an expert on weapons of mass destruction, and a Bahai follower - was found dead in the woods of Oxfordshire, England. The directors meet with a British intelligence analyst, the head of the Bahai faith in England, and an investigative journalist. They meet some elderly and sweet Bahais who knew both Kelly and the American CIA agent, but who are uncomfortable giving out \\\\\\&amp;#039;classified\\\\\\&amp;#039; information. It is only then that Asaf and Naama realize that chasing a CIA agent and a dead scientist is stretching their detective skills.\n\nThey return to Israel and convince the Bahai administration in Haifa to show them around the undergound city of Mount Carmel. (From the US, in English and Hebrew, English subtitles) (Documentary)\n\nDuration: 60 minutes Appx.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:990a370971c221db1d392684b11561b6152a471f","amp;dn":"Bahais+In+My+Backyard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"990a370971c221db1d392684b11561b6152a471f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,10,55,9,113,194,33,219,29,57,38,132,177,21,97,182,21,42,71,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
