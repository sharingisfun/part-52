Others upload the &quot;whole thing&quot; and put up 7G or more - beautiful! If you have very good space on the harddrive, and are blessed whith a lot of paciens.\n\nI make the best possible copys in DVD5 format.\n\n\n\nThis means;\n\nAlways DolbyDigital 5.1 at least - Some of my Classics excluded, of course. I love DTS, but never on the expence of video quality. \n\n\nVideo uncompressed or shrinked as little as possible. If I can&amp;#039;t make the torrent as good that I won&amp;#039;t see any differens whith my own eyes I don&amp;#039;t upload it.\n\n\nMenues is usually stripped. It isn&amp;#039;t worth even 1% compression of the videoquality to have menues, but sometimes there is space for them, and if that&amp;#039;s the case, they are included.\n\n\nSubs and languages shows at the top of this side.\n\n\nSFV-file included\n\n\n\nSeeding...\nDon&amp;#039;t comment this, please.\nWe got a upload limit on TPB on 128kbs, and when you start a new torrent, it&amp;#039;s just to be pacient. I sometimes put up more than one torrent at the time, and then I have to prioritate one to get fast help with the seeding. This sometimes means that it can take a day or two before you got a acceptable seed, and I&amp;#039;m sorry for that.\nIf you like my uploads - help me seed them! Then I can put up more torrents of the movies you like. It really is that simple. If I have to use my bandwith to seed old torrents, I can&amp;#039;t put up any new ones.\nThis is the way to make sites like TPB works. Help eachother!\n\nThis aint illegal. It can&amp;#039;t be. This is true, wordwide, unstopable love amongs people - sharing very wanted things among eachother with no payment in mind at all.\n\n\nIt&amp;#039;s simply beautiful... \n\nSharing is caring.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSurtan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d660c6edceae8a0edf9f769dee8ffe77459e52b0","amp;dn":"Die+Hard+-by+Surtan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d660c6edceae8a0edf9f769dee8ffe77459e52b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,96,198,237,206,174,138,14,223,159,118,157,238,143,254,119,69,158,82,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
