They might had the idea to catch hippy-non-smokers with cool sounds. If you can imagine to join the Yardbirds or early Velvet Underground in their homestudios you might get an idea how this records sounds like. Great all-english vocals, fuzz-guitars and organ. Totally stoned and rough. We personally think those bands are actually from US. There is not a single sitar/tabla or other India influence music on it. Instead: ROUGH GARAGE-SOUND and FUZZED-OUT MAYHEM. Originals are rare as golddust. This Double LP was released as 2 single albums. Voted from many dealers and collectors as the BEST RE-ISSUE EVER.\n\nIts all cool music and its a genre I dig, so grab it while you can :D\n\nHQ VBR\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Confusion - Voice from the inner soul.mp3\n02 - Dinosaurs - You can't beat it.mp3\n03 - X'lents - Psychedelia.mp3\n04 - Genuine spares - Proper stranger.mp3\n05 - Dinosaurs - Sinister purpose.mp3\n06 - Great bear - Mist.mp3\n07 - X'lents - Born on the bayou.mp3\n08 - Innerlight - Baby baby please.mp3\n09 - The fentones - Simla beat theme.mp3\n10 - Nomads - Nothing is the same.mp3\n11 - Hypnotic eye - killing floor.mp3\n12 - Velvette fog - I'm so glad.mp3\n13 - Black beats - The mod trade.mp3\n14 - Brood of vipers - Psychedelic web.mp3\n15 - Hypnotic eye - Aimless lady.mp3\n16 - Pat farrell - Brand new baby.mp3\n17 - The conductors - She said so.mp3\n18 - Soul Generation - I can't see you.mp3\n19 - The couriers - Feelings.mp3\n20 - Changing tymes - You make it hard.mp3\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09969cc00f53d7008bf989a76a3cf12684860b15","amp;dn":"VA+-+Simla+Beat+1970-71+%282CD+Rare+Indian+Psychedelia+-+224Vbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09969cc00f53d7008bf989a76a3cf12684860b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,150,156,192,15,83,215,0,139,249,137,167,106,60,241,38,132,134,11,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
