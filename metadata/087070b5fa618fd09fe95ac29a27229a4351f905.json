Here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s what wikipedia has to say about starsiege:\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nStarsiege is a mecha-style simulation game developed by Dynamix and released in 1999. Starsiege is set in the Earthsiege universe, which contains its predecessors Earthsiege (1994), Battledrome (1995), and Earthsiege 2 (1995), as well as action game Hunter Hunted (1996), strategy games Mission Force: Cyberstorm (1997) and Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars (1998), and first-person shooters Starsiege: Tribes (1999), Tribes 2 (2001), and Tribes: Vengeance (2004). Starsiege is the end of the Earthsiege series and the beginning of the Tribes series.\n\nAs a simulation, Starsiege offers players the ability to pilot a wide variety of massive bipedal war machines known as HERCULANs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;HERCs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; for short), as well as several tanks. Set in 2829, Starsiege contains an array of advanced technology, and numerous upgrades are available for each vehicle. Starsiege takes place across a number of planets and moons in the solar system, offering a range of different locations throughout the game and in multiplayer battles, including Earth (Terra), Titan, Luna, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. There are two campaigns, Human and Cybrid. The human campaign places the player as a member of the Free Martian Alliance (a faction of the Martian rebellion, detailed later).\n________________________________________________________________________________\nThank you so much for downloading!!!!\n\nIz\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087070b5fa618fd09fe95ac29a27229a4351f905","amp;dn":"Starsiege+Full+Multiplayer+%28stable%29+nocd+-+upgraded+to+1.004-+me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087070b5fa618fd09fe95ac29a27229a4351f905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,112,112,181,250,97,143,208,159,233,90,194,154,39,34,154,67,81,249,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
