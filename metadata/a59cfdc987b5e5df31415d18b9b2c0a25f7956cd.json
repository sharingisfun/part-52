If we could just improve the efficiency of how we use our PCs, the savings in energy costs would be over $3 billion dollars! The CO2 emissions from just 15 computers are equivalent in energy terms to the gas consumption used by one car.\n\nLocal Cooling will:\n\n    * Cut your energy bills.\n    * Reduce the amount of Greenhouse Gas CO2 emissions as a result of your reduced PC power consumption.\n    * Give you full control over your power mode settings.\n    * Improve your overall computing experience and efficiency.\n    * Show you in detail how much you have saved since installing the software.\n\nWebsite: http://www.localcooling.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59cfdc987b5e5df31415d18b9b2c0a25f7956cd","amp;dn":"LocalCooling+-+Save+energy+and+save+the+world+with+your+computer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59cfdc987b5e5df31415d18b9b2c0a25f7956cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,156,253,201,135,181,229,223,49,65,93,24,185,178,192,162,95,121,86,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
