I upload their first LP from 1982, later rereleased on CD. More about the band and its history here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brygada_Kryzys A half of the songs from the CD is sung in Polish, the other half in English. The music itself surprisingly has not grown old much.\n\nThe upload contains:\n- the CD content converted with Ogg Vorbis encoder v.1.12 (Q8, approx. 256 Kbps) with AotuV optizations, properly tagged\n- the miniature of the cover (400x400 pixels)\n- the copy of original contract between the band and the recording company (what the LP contains, play times, etc., as you see the LP was recorded with a Studer studio tape recorder :-)) \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07882a09c3e9ede8f2e21effddc6ef39153dbaa7","amp;dn":"Brygada+Kryzys+-+Brygada+Kryzys+%5BOgg+Vorbis+Q8%5D%5B1982%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07882a09c3e9ede8f2e21effddc6ef39153dbaa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,136,42,9,195,233,237,232,242,226,30,255,221,198,239,57,21,61,186,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
