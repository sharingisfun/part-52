Some describe them as the bastard\nsons of Cheap Trick and Fountains Of Wayne, while\nothers compare them more to what the Clash might\nhave been had they listened to a lot more KISS. Too\npop to be rock, too rock to be pop, the band's\nragged rock-and-roll enthusiasm is always tempered\nby the need to get those four-part harmonies just\nright.\n\nThe band's precursor EP (produced by Whiskeytown's\nMike Daly, and also available here on CDBaby.com)\nturned some heads by being the #1 seller on\nCDBaby.com in its first two weeks and a continuous\ntop-seller since. And as one of the top-ten most\nadded records in the country in its first week at\nradio, it later broke into the CMJ Top 200 chart. It\nwasn't long before many TV and film placements came\nthrough MTV, Sony, Disney and several independents,\nculminating in a national heavy-use placement of\ntheir song, &quot;Nice to See You,&quot; by the ABC Family\nChannel over the past year on network and cable. Not\ntoo shabby for an unsigned band doing it all on\ntheir own.\n\nThis new self-titled record is the band's first\nfull-length, so the CD Release itself warranted a\nbig show and a huge party. On June 4th, 2005, Fooled\nBy April headlined in front of 300 people at the\nParadise Rock Club with their good buddies Scamper\nsupporting, along with two hot new major label acts\nopening, The Redwalls and American Minor. It was a\ncrowning achievement after the band's relentless\ntouring of the Northeast and Midwest, which has\nbrought them to many showcases at the CMJ Music\nFestival in New York City, the NEMO Festival in\nBoston and the prestigious South by Southwest\nFestival in Austin, TX.\n\nEnjoy the record, and please leave a comment and let\nthe boys know what you think!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f5ffe7c9b4b1f825da9680dd968d087164908a","amp;dn":"Fooled_By_April-Fooled_By_April-2005-EGO+%5BRock%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f5ffe7c9b4b1f825da9680dd968d087164908a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,245,255,231,201,180,177,248,37,218,150,128,221,150,141,8,113,100,144,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
