Most of them could not get\npast the loss of Charlie Sexton. \nKoella never played the same solo, not even the next day playing the same song as the night before.\nJust compare this to, let\\&amp;#039;s say Denny Freeman and I rest my case.\n\nDuring this tour many guest guitarists joined Dylan on stage. In this compilation Chuck Loeb \nand Tommy Morrongiello are present. Loeb with the best solo I ever heard in Dylan\\&amp;#039;s band.\nHe plays it in Watching the river flow and the taper does not know who is responsible for this \nreally great solo. He films every guitarist but forgets the man playing behind Dylan\\&amp;#039;s position.\n\nI like to thank and honour all tapers for their material!!!\n\nLineage: several disks&gt;Bose321&gt;LiteOn LVW 5045HD&gt;Freddy disk&gt;DVDdecrypter&gt;maketorrent&gt;Dime&gt;you\n\nThe songs consist of both NTSC and Pal but should play on every player due to Liteon logics.\n\nMD5 Chcksums are present in seperate folder\n\nThe resulting disk has a Liteon logic menu: 16 songs with 16 pictograms, max 6 per page.\nYou can select a song by clicking on the picture and the rest of the disc plays from there.\nAt the bottom of the page you can select next or prev page (&gt;&gt; or&lt;&lt;)\nSince not all songs are from Sound Upgraded disks, you may have to ajust the volume here and there.\n\nBand:\n\nBob Dylan- vocal, piano/organ\nTony Garnier- bass\nFreddy Koella- guitar\nLarry Campbell- guitar\nGeorge Recile-drums\nRichie Hayward - additional drums during spring 2004\n\nGuest guitarists: Chuck Loeb, Tommy Morrongiello\n\nSongs:\n\n1.
