It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.\n\nProcess MonitorÃ‚Â´s user interface and options are similar to those of Filemon and Regmon, but it was written from the ground up and includes numerous significant enhancements, such as:\n\n* Monitoring of process and thread startup and exit, including exit status codes\n* Monitoring of image (DLL and kernel-mode device driver) loads\n* More data captured for operation input and output parameters\n* Non-destructive filters allow you to set filters without losing data\n* Capture of thread stacks for each operation make it possible in many cases to identify the root cause of an operation\n* Reliable capture of process details, including image path, command line, user and session ID\n* Configurable and moveable columns for any event property\n* Filters can be set for any data field, including fields not configured as columns\n* Advanced logging architecture scales to tens of millions of captured events and gigabytes of log data\n* Process tree tool shows relationship of all processes referenced in a trace\n* Native log format preserves all data for loading in a different Process Monitor instance\n* Process tooltip for easy viewing of process image information\n* Detail tooltip allows convenient access to formatted data that doesnÃ‚Â´t fit in the columna\n\nProcess Monitor runs on Windows 2000 SP4 with Update Rollup 1, Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP1, and Windows Vista as well as x64 versions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows Vista.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eb5b33d00f8b121a06366445f1e82f2b86adec2","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Process+Monitor+1.22+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eb5b33d00f8b121a06366445f1e82f2b86adec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,181,179,61,0,248,177,33,160,99,102,68,95,30,130,242,184,106,222,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
