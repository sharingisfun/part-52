This release also contains the Pikey subtitles.\n\nThis is for all those who love h.264 quality!\n\n\n\n\nTurkish and his close friend/accomplice Tommy get pulled into the world of match fixing by the notorious Brick Top. Things get complicated when the boxer they had lined up gets the shit kicked out of him by Pitt, a &amp;#039;pikey&amp;#039; ( slang for an Irish Gypsy)- who comes into the equation after Turkish, an unlicensed boxing promoter wants to buy a caravan off the Irish Gypsies. They then try to convince Pitt not only to fight for them, but to lose for them too. Whilst all this is going on, a huge diamond heist takes place, and a fistful of motley characters enter the story, including &amp;#039;Cousin Avi&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Boris The Blade&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Franky Four Fingers&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Bullet Tooth Tony&amp;#039;. Things go from bad to worse as it all becomes about the money, the guns, and the damned dog!\n\n\n\nIMDB link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208092/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208092/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlright. Let&amp;#039;s have some Q and A:\n\nQ:  Section 8, why are your mp4 releases so large? :(\n\nA:  I can spell it out real simply. They are of very high quality. They have not been resized and shrunk to a horizontal resolution of 640 like many releases. They retain their original horizontal resolution of 720. If you compare these releases to the original DVD material I think you will be hard pressed to notice a difference. The difference is transparent to the human eye. I encode my movies to be the same quality as the original material when viewed on my 92 inch HD screen.\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nAvinaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Snatch.mp4\nDate: 4/08/2007 11:27:39\nSize: 1,122,172,056 bytes (1070.187 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:42:43 (6163.241666 s)\nContainer type: MP4/MOV\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCreation time: 3/08/2007 15:24:41 UTC\nModification time: 3/08/2007 15:24:41 UTC\nNumber of streams: 4\nType of stream nr. 1: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (mp4a) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (mp4a) {Comentary}\nType of stream nr. 4: text (tx3g) {GPAC Streaming Text Handler}\nAudio streams: 2\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 720 x 464\nWidth: multiple of 16\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec: avc1\nResolution: 720 x 464\nFrame aspect ratio: 45:29 = 1.551724\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 45:29 = 1.551724\nFramerate: 23.976023 fps\nNumber of frames: 147768\nBitrate: 1254.663360 kbps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec: mp4a\nBitrate: 128.538367 kbps\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec: mp4a\nBitrate: 69.313398 kbps\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5642f4630881232e46a276dacaac9d006f68a9c","amp;dn":"Snatch+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5642f4630881232e46a276dacaac9d006f68a9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,100,47,70,48,136,18,50,228,106,39,109,172,170,201,208,6,246,138,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
