With a simple keystroke, cities, villages or other places of interest will have their names shown hovering above them in the FS World. It is by no means complete, but the database covers A LOT. In many countries, even third world ones, you will see place names for locations that in real life are host to no more than a camel tied to a tree, a mail box or a deserted inconvenience store. It really adds to the FS experience.\n\nA working patcher is included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32576f6055fac9c4b33bf60234d19af26df21fc6","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Abacus+EZ-Landmark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32576f6055fac9c4b33bf60234d19af26df21fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,87,111,96,85,250,201,196,179,59,246,2,52,209,154,242,109,242,31,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
