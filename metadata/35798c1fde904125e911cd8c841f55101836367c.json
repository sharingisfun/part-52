Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35798c1fde904125e911cd8c841f55101836367c","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B08.24.07%5D+-+George+Knapp.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35798c1fde904125e911cd8c841f55101836367c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,121,140,31,222,144,65,37,233,17,205,140,132,31,85,16,24,54,54,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
