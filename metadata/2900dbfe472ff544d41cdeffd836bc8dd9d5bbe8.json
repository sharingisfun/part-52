Right from the beginning of ?The Wind Blows Witches from the Sky? you know you have a monster record on your hand. Even though these guys are drenched in classic rock, it&amp;#039;s still got newer twists to it and a bit of doom here and there. For the most part the whole CD song after song has the kind of intensity as bands like back in the day, Hendrix Zeppelin or Cream came across as...hard rock, blues based and heavy. Musically it reminds me of something that the Masters of Reality or the Queens might do also though. Fuzzed out bass and heavy stomps over and over with tasteful guitar and melody lines that are super catchy, but not cheesy. The production is also done nicely...every tone and sound on it is crisp and very professional sounding. Maybe that is partially why I like this album; it is very, very reminiscent of a Chris Goss production.&quot; (StonerRock.com, January 18, 2004)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2900dbfe472ff544d41cdeffd836bc8dd9d5bbe8","amp;dn":"Wallrus+-+Burn+the+shivers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2900dbfe472ff544d41cdeffd836bc8dd9d5bbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,0,219,254,71,47,245,68,212,28,222,255,216,54,188,141,217,213,187,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
