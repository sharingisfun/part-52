A flashback to four weeks earlier shows Reuben meeting with Vegas&amp;#039; most hated businessman, Willy Bank (Al Pacino) on the construction site of their new hotel. After Reuben secures crucial deals for Bank, he is intimidated into giving up his part of the investment, a strategy often employed by the vindictive Bank in previous deals. The shock causes Reuben&amp;#039;s heart attack.\n\nThe gang swears to take revenge on Bank by utterly ruining his hotel, &quot;The Bank&quot;, on the night of its grand opening. They aim to rig the various games at the casino so the players will win instead of the house. Bank was forced to take some hostile investors onto his Board of Directors to open the hotel, and if the house does not make at least $500 million in the first quarter, Bank will be removed from the chairmanship of his own hotel. The team also wishes to destroy any chance of Bank&amp;#039;s winning the prestigious Five Diamond Award, the highest distinction granted a hotel. All of Bank&amp;#039;s other hotels have won this award, and he has purchased valuable diamond necklaces to commemorate the successes. He has already optimistically purchased a necklace for his new hotel as well.[/b][/color] \n\n\nFile INFO:\n       \n*Release name: Oceans.13.2007.R5.Line.XViD-ViSUAL                          \n*Release type: xvid                                                   \n*Relase  CDS : 2                                                    \n*Video       : 1498  kb/s                                         \n*Audio       : 160  kb/s VBR MP3 \n*LANGUAGE    : English                              \n*Subtitles   : Bulgarian                                                \n*Filenaming. : vis-ocenas13a.rar vis-oceans13b.rar\n*SiZE        : 1,36 GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949c624d93b12755d66c58d4f1acef04112e2e44","amp;dn":"Oceans.13.2007.R5.Line.XViD-ViSUAL%28bg+sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949c624d93b12755d66c58d4f1acef04112e2e44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,156,98,77,147,177,39,85,214,108,88,212,241,172,239,4,17,46,46,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
