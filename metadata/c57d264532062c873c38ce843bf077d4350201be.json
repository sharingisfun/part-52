He lured them to his apartment by promising drinks,\npornographic videos and even money to some in exchange for sex. \nonce inside his apartment, he would slip a potent sedative into their drinks, strangle them and then dismember their bodies with an electric saw. \nOn occasion, he ate some of their flesh. \nBut the secret and bizarre world of this serial killer would eventually be revealed. On July 22, 1991, two Milwaukee police officers talked to a man named \nTracy Edwards. There was something odd about him. Handcuffs were dangling from one of his wrists. \nEdwards told police a strange tale of a man who held him hostage and threatened him with a knife. \nThe man&amp;#039;s name was Jeffrey Dahmer. \n\nThe Grisly Discovery \nEdwards led the two officers to Dahmer&amp;#039;s one-bedroom apartment at 924 North 25th Street. \nThey were met by Dahmer, 31, who answered the door, and an overwhelming stench. Edwards instructed police to look in the bedroom for a knife.\nWhen an officer went inside the room, he found photographs of human remains. The other officer opened the refrigerator and quickly slammed the door shut when he saw a human head inside. \nInvestigators found seven skulls, four heads, body parts and photos of naked and dismembered victims inside the small apartment. \nHuman remains were found preserved in formaldehyde, and heads had been boiled. Dahmer told police how he had poured acid over flesh to dissolve remains.\nHe had kept strips of flesh in his freezer for later consumption. \nDahmer was unmasked to the world as one of America&amp;#039;s most notorious serial killers. He gave police a 160-page confession detailing how he lured, \nmurdered and then dismembered the remains of his victims. He provided gruesome details of a killing spree that began in 1978 in Ohio and stretched to Wisconsin by 1991. \n\n&quot;It&amp;#039;s hard for me to believe that a human being could have done what I&amp;#039;ve done, but I know that I did,&quot; Dahmer said in his confession. \n\n********************************************************************************\n\n On january 27th 1993,jeffery dahmer was brought to trial in milwaukee for the serial killing of fifteen young men.\n That he commited these appalling crimes was never in doubt as dahmer pleaded guilty,but his defence was based on the grounds of insanity. \nif found to have been mad ,he would not go to prison,but to a mental institution for the criminally insane,from which he could petition for release every six months......\nThe trial of jeffey dahmer provides a vivid and shocking account of the activities of a serial killer.\nThe trial itself was disinguished by a masterly summary from the court appointed forensic scientist and hinges on the prosecutions attempts to prove that dahmer knew what he was doing when he enticed ,\nkilled and dismembered his victims...\n\nTreading a fine line between fascination and disgust towards a man who could commit such attrocious crimes,\nthis film provides genuine courtroom footage and the facts behind the case.\nThis programme is of great interest to all concerned with the issue of insanity as a defense , \ndetermine for yourself how and why dahmer delighted in killing black youths.....\n\n ******************************************************************************\n\n\n  Directed by journalist and tv producer elkan allan,who was presented at milwaukee for the trial...\n  Produced by stephan sargent at spitfire tv...  \n\n\n************\n\nENJOY...and please seed ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c57d264532062c873c38ce843bf077d4350201be","amp;dn":"THE+TRIAL+OF+JEFFREY+DAHMER+.+vhs+rip+.+xvid+.+1993+.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c57d264532062c873c38ce843bf077d4350201be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,125,38,69,50,6,44,135,60,56,206,132,59,240,119,212,53,2,1,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
