I have included all the different variations of one song that could be heard. There were at first twice as much files, but many proved to be exact doubles after much careful listening.\n\n\nIf you are still reading, and i hope you are, it is important to say that you can easily listen to this using Foobar, the best audioplayer i know. I know some wish i can do a Flac encoding of this. I will do this when i find the proper method to preserve the 6 channels. Then it will be easier to play back, even though the total size will be much bigger with no quality improvement.\n\nStay posted, the FLAC Version will appear within 24hours i estimate! \n\n\n\nThanks for reading,  thanks for buying NIN material,  nothing, specially this torrent, can replace the experience of watching this live dvd.\n\n\nPS: If the second dvd contains different audio menus, i will rip this as well.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a546bf226f67f654d2e75df63f25883e059c57c","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+And+All+That+Could+Have+Been+DVD-1+Menu+Rip+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a546bf226f67f654d2e75df63f25883e059c57c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,84,107,242,38,246,127,101,77,46,117,223,99,242,88,131,224,89,197,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
