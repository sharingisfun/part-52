In a town near Little Rock, Lucy Fowler works hard for a construction firm; on weekends she drinks, goes home with someone, and come early morning, wakes and leaves as fast as she can. She cares a lot about her father, newly back in town, a painfully shy man who has nothing to say to her. She does go to a Holy Roller church with him about the same time that she starts, fitfully, a relationship with Cal Percell, new in town and a good guy. She kisses him sober, but still has demons to confront. What&amp;#039;s the source of her careless ways; can she turn coal into a diamond?\nTrailor:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457308/trailers-screenplay-E30054-10-2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f8d0750168312a517a0076c21d2de11e52d7ec","amp;dn":"Come+Early+Morning.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f8d0750168312a517a0076c21d2de11e52d7ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,248,208,117,1,104,49,42,81,122,0,118,194,29,45,225,30,82,215,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
