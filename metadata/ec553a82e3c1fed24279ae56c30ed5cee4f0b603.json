The film was based on Harold Sinclair&amp;#039;s novel of the same name. The team of John Lee Mahin and Martin Rackin both wrote the screenplay and produced the movie.\n\nThe movie is based on the true story of Grierson&amp;#039;s Raid, led by Colonel Benjamin Grierson who, along with 1700 men, set out from northern Mississippi and rode several hundred miles behind enemy lines in April of 1863 to cut the railroad between Newton Station and Vicksburg, Mississippi. Grierson&amp;#039;s raid was part of the Union campaign, culminating in the Battle of Vicksburg. The raid was as successful as it was daring, and remarkably bloodless. By attacking the Confederate-controlled railroad it upset the plans and troop deployments of Confederate General John C. Pemberton\n\n\n\nDvd5 .
