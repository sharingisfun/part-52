Although it won an Oscar for Best Documentary, it is fiction. It was intended as an hour-long program to air on BBC 1, but it was deemed too intense and violent to broadcast. It went to theatrical distribution as a feature film instead. Low-budget and shot on location, it strives for and achieves convincing and unflinching realism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81384c91e37aeacb34b54e3c81b9e53de122ff5f","amp;dn":"The+war+game_La+bombe_Peter+Watkins_640x480_DivX+5_Douste_blazy.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81384c91e37aeacb34b54e3c81b9e53de122ff5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,56,76,145,227,122,234,203,52,181,78,60,129,185,229,61,225,34,255,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
