This is similar to the third release &quot;Holding_On.&quot; The name of the album is a rip on the official remix album named &quot;Y34RZ3R0R4M1X3D.&quot; \n\t\n\tThe tracks chosen came from ninremixes.com. I recommend going there and checking out some of the stuff that remix artists have made. These are my favorite tracks I could find of each song, so this is based solely on my personal opinion. People think I did a good job choosing the tracks the first time around so I am doing this again. Note that I am not the type of person that likes to put the same song on CD five times. These are 11 awesome fan remixes and the people who made these are very/extremely/super talented. Thanks guys and gals for making these tracks!\n\n\tThe artwork was chosen was originally by redlinkmaster at echoingthesound.org. I just edited it a little bit. He did a great job on it so I chose it. \n\t\nFarewell: Hope you enjoy. This is the SIXTH release. \n\nCredits to: Everyone who was behind making these tracks. redlinkmaster for the artwork. 9inchnails.com for &quot;The Limitless Potential&quot; &amp;#039;cause some of those tracks are on here.\n\nReleases:\n1_Guns N&amp;#039; Roses - Appetite for Democracy\n2_Metallica - &quot;The New Album&quot; (Live Bootlegs)\n3_Nine Inch Nails - Holding_On\n4_Trent Reznor/Peter Murphy - Radioshows\n5_Red Hot Chili Peppers - Stadium Arcadium: Venus (B-Sides Compilation)\n6_Nine Inch Nails - Y34RZ3R0F4NR3M1X3D\n\n(foog release, nothing creative, but a shitty attempt to be)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95e0a14b10a218806f4749452c9f6e1a75ee1580","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Y34RZ3R0F4NR3M1X3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95e0a14b10a218806f4749452c9f6e1a75ee1580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,224,161,75,16,162,24,128,111,71,73,69,44,159,110,26,117,238,21,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
