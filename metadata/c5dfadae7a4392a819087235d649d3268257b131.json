They released three demos which were all highly acclaimed, receiving only positive response from the press around the world. At last their third demo woke up the true interest of record companies and Shade Empire was signed to Italian Avantgarde Music.\n\nAfter signing a new deal with Dynamic Arts Records band have delivered without doubt the album of their career so far, recreating the right balance of aggressiviness and melody! Haunting melodies and on top of it all a superb production will not leave you with indifference.\nWith this brand new trauma, &quot;Intoxicate O.S.&quot; Shade Empire will expand their audience&amp;#039;s awareness into the next level!\n\no--------------------------------------o\n|01 - Slitwrist Ecstasy.mp3            |\n|02 - Bloodstar.mp3                    |\n|03 - Chemical God.mp3                 |\n|04 - Rat In A Maze.mp3                |\n|05 - Soulslayer.mp3                   |\n|06 - The Silver Fix.mp3               |\n|07 - Embrace The Gods Of Suffering.mp3|\n|08 - Ravine.mp3                       |\n|09 - Hatefeast.mp3                    |\no--------------------------------------o","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5dfadae7a4392a819087235d649d3268257b131","amp;dn":"Shade+Empire+-+2006+-+Intoxicate+O.S.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5dfadae7a4392a819087235d649d3268257b131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,223,173,174,122,67,146,168,25,8,114,53,214,73,211,38,130,87,177,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
