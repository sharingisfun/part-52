The last &quot;real&quot; album with the Tatts, they replaced their geetarplayer for their next album, and went thru lots of other lineup changes over the next years. THis album isnt quite as good as their debut from 1978, but this record still kicks serious ass. I saw Mad Max 3 the other day and the dude who plays ironbar - that was none other then Angry Anderson, ie the frontman of Rose Tattoo, :D Yay ! That guy is LEGEND as far as Im concerned.\n\nAll sorts of comments, praise, critic, general bullshit or a thank you, ie any kind of feedback is of course always appreciated when uploading o_^\n\n192kbs\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
