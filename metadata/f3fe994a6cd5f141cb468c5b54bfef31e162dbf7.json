Sounds a bit like a very fuzzed out early psychedelic Electric Prunes record, with swirling acid fuzz-geetar and fantastic organ interplay mixed with a raw mexican garage kinda feel to it. Originally only pressed in 200 copies so I`d have to sell a kidney to afford a original pressing ^_^\nThis is a reissue (Doh!) and tis a very very good record imho. All sorts of comments, praise, critic, general bullshit or a thank you, ie any kind of feedback is of course always appreciated when uploading o_^\n\n224Vbr\n\nTrack listing:\n1. Hang Out,\n2.
