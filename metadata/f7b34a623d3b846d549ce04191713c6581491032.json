Rory was the pearl of Irish rock and blues. He died untimely but his legacy lives on as long as his generation is around. This CD (titled misleadingly The best of Taste) contains all the tracks of their two studio LPs (Taste and On the boards) in a mixed order. mp3 192 kbs. Absolutely great and unique R&amp;B music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7b34a623d3b846d549ce04191713c6581491032","amp;dn":"Taste+-+2+studio+LPs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7b34a623d3b846d549ce04191713c6581491032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,179,74,98,61,59,132,109,84,156,224,65,145,113,60,101,129,73,16,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
