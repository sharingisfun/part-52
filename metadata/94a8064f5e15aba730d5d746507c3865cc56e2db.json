Darth Vader is dead, but a reborn EmpireÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½under a mysterious new leader strikes back at the struggling Rebel Alliance. Massive World Devastators, more powerful and unstoppable than the Death Star, ravage entire planets, while the ruthless heirs of Jabba the Hutt place a monumental price on the heads of Princess Leia and her husband, Han Solo. Along with Lando, Chewbacca, Artoo, Threepio, and other old allies, Han and Leia struggle to protect the future for their unborn child. But their greatest foe may be their closest friend: Luke Skywalker&quot;\n\nDark Empire came out in 1991 and 1992.  This is one of my favorite Star Wars comics ever, and has the most stunning art I&amp;#039;ve ever seen in a comic book.  I highly recommend this to any Star Wars fan!\n\nIf this gets a good response I&amp;#039;ll upload Dark Empire II and Empire&amp;#039;s End, the second and third part of the trilogy.  Thanks!\n\nAlso, if anybody has any requests for Star Wars (or some other comics I may have, who knows), just leave a comment, and I&amp;#039;ll put it up for you!  I have every SW comic made, so anything goes!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94a8064f5e15aba730d5d746507c3865cc56e2db","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+Dark+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94a8064f5e15aba730d5d746507c3865cc56e2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,168,6,79,94,21,171,167,48,213,215,70,80,124,56,101,204,86,226,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
