Here are just a few of them that I have compiled into a video DVD. Approximately 2 hours of vintage Chevrolet ephemeral films.\n\nTHIS IS A 100% LEGAL TORRENT. All the individual films are in the public domain. The DVD as a whole is under Creative Commons copyright -- you may freely copy and distribute it, provided that it is not changed in any way and no charge is made for it.\n\nThis torrent also includes my original artwork for the DVD label.\n\n** CONTENTS **\nAll five &quot;Nicky Nome&quot; cartoons:\n- A Coach for Cinderella\n- A Ride for Cinderella\n- One Bad Knight\n- Peg Leg Pedro\n- The Princess and the Pauper\nBack of the Mike\nDown the Gasoline Trail\nAll in One\nDrawing Account\nJust a Spark\nSky Billboards\nHow to Go Places\nLet Yourself Go\nLeave It to Roll-Oh\n\nSuitable for all ages. &quot;The Princess and the Pauper&quot; contains vintage racial stereotypes that are no longer considered acceptable.\n\nI will seed for as long as I can, but I have limited hard drive space and can&amp;#039;t always be online. So if you like it, please pick it up and seed it.\n\nI am continuing to create similar DVDs for my own use and will continue uploading them here if people want them.\n\nHOW TO (for beginners):\n1 - Use WinRAR to unzip the file. Inside will be two folders, AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS.\n2 - Use the freeware program ImgBurn to &quot;build&quot; these folders into a DVD disk image.\n3 - Use ImgBurn or your favourite burning program to burn onto a blank DVD.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73dc6eb747eb8eba10d3c579e81d0fed81a901d3","amp;dn":"Trout+Vintage+Films+-+Chevrolet+Presents+%28NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73dc6eb747eb8eba10d3c579e81d0fed81a901d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,220,110,183,71,235,142,186,16,211,197,121,232,29,15,237,129,169,1,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
