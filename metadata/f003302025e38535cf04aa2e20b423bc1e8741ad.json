During the 1980&amp;#039;s, NHK\nJapan (Pony Video) released three Tom Baker episodes on VHS in Japan, with Japanese voice dubbing, different \nincidental music and modified opening and closing segments.  Those episodes were Robots of Death, Revenge of the \nCybermen and Pyramids of Mars.   \n\nThere have always been rumors that other episodes were given the same Japanese treatment of professional \nvoice dubbing, different music and opening and closing credits, but none have ever surfaced.  Until now.   \n\nHere you have Genesis of the Daleks.   It has never been released by BBC, NHK or Pony Video, and has only been \nbroadcast twice on TV in Japan.  \n\nThis version is the highest video and audio quality possible and is perfect for an iPod.  If you do not have \nan iPod, you can watch it with GOMPLAYER, (a free download, excellent video viewer that is better than Windows\nMedia player)...   \n\nWe are still searching Japan to see if more of these rare episodes can be located.   \n\nDo enjoy!    \n\n\nTheDoctor05\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f003302025e38535cf04aa2e20b423bc1e8741ad","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Genesis+of+the+Daleks+-+Japanese+-+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f003302025e38535cf04aa2e20b423bc1e8741ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,3,48,32,37,227,133,53,207,4,170,46,32,180,35,188,30,135,65,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
