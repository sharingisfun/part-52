In fact, this is the modus operandi for the lion&amp;#039;s share of the songs on the band&amp;#039;s self-titled debut album. Judging from the chart placing of 12 STONES it seems that the gambit worked in a big way. And why not? With such songs as &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Back Up&quot; those who appreciate the heavy stuff and the mellower mode in equal measure can have their cake and eat it too. Just don&amp;#039;t get any of that cake on the band&amp;#039;s rug, because judging from the piercing attack of those grinding guitars, they know how to administer the proverbial beatin&amp;#039;.\n\n\n\n1.
