The spirit of good time is known only in Ireland as the craic.\n\nIan begins his trip on the spectacular Antrim coast in Northern Ireland, boasting a geological wonder known as Giant&amp;#039;s Causeway. The origins and name of this rocky landmark are enshrouded in myth and speculation, though Ian has his own theories.\n\nBelfast is the city where Northern Ireland&amp;#039;s political troubles have been most intense. Ian takes a cab ride through the city and learns about the perils of Belfast life, and the terrifying events his driver has witnessed. That evening Ian tours the lively bars and clubs of the city on a mission to discover for himself the true meaning of craic.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pilotguides.com/tv_shows/globe_trekker/shows/europe/ireland.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pilotguides.com/tv_shows/globe_trekker/shows/europe/ireland.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e6101a80b35676f4c59bd6e3fff6af1acb5b8f9","amp;dn":"Pilot+Guides+-+Ireland+%5BRQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e6101a80b35676f4c59bd6e3fff6af1acb5b8f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,97,1,168,11,53,103,111,76,89,189,110,63,255,106,241,172,181,184,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
