From these various groups, &quot;divine&quot; bloodlines emerged, assuming the &quot;right to rule.&quot;\n\nThe Illuminati keep people under control via the chemical poisoning of the food supply, and eventually plan to microchip the entire population for complete external control, he outlined. However, he noted that people can break free by not identifying with the &quot;body computer&quot; or five senses. &quot;We&amp;#039;ve forgotten that we&amp;#039;re an expression of infinite consciousness,&quot; and become identified with &quot;the small instead of the all,&quot; said Icke.\n\nIn the 2008 election, both Giuliani and Hillary Clinton are Illuminati candidates-- &quot;puppets of the hidden force,&quot; he declared, adding that Hillary is a particularly powerful figure in the Illuminati.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a98cbfd0c4d9b50b166214f198b80f69c4d273e1","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+-+George+Noory+w%2F+David+Icke+11%2F20%2F2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a98cbfd0c4d9b50b166214f198b80f69c4d273e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,140,191,208,196,217,181,11,22,98,20,241,152,184,15,105,196,210,115,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
