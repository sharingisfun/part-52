But then came Motorhead up on stage blasting out high-energy three-chord punk rock with a metallic edge, all the while looking like longhaired bikers from hell... \n--------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen Ian &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister was arrested and exiled from his old band, Hawkwind, he wasn&amp;#039;t about ready to stop making music. After getting back on track, he formed a new trio called Motorhead, named for a song he originally performed back in his Hawkwind days. Over the years they would rise to fame as the founding fathers of thrash/speed metal, but in their early days the band was pretty much unrecognized. The band&amp;#039;s early recording sessions didn&amp;#039;t gain any attention. But once Kilmister had recruited classic band members &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clark and Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor, he got the opportunity to record an album. In just two days, the band recorded what got released as their debut album...\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nMotohead&amp;#039;s 1977 self-titled debut includes the same buzz-saw punk metal that the trio would soon take to the top of the U.K. charts, and which would make them one of rock&amp;#039;s most influential outfits. Included are such classic cuts as the title track, &quot;Iron Horse/Born To Lose&quot;, &quot;Lost Johnny&quot;, and &quot;The Watcher&quot;.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Motorhead\n02. Vibrator\n03.
