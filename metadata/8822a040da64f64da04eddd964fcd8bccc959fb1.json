When compiled onto one disc, the collection makes total sense. Bob Dylan is represented, as are Carole King, James Taylor, the Pretenders and Squeeze. From Elton John&amp;#039;s &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; to The Band&amp;#039;s &quot;The Weight,&quot; it is apparent that Crow didn&amp;#039;t rattle off tunes that she thought would make her sound cool and informed. Instead, she took the project seriously and, with thoughtfulness, stitched together a musical quilt that she feels has warmed her sound. This is a must-have for anyone interested in songwriting and songwriters, or Sheryl Crow.\n--Dan Aquilante, New York Post, April 2003","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8822a040da64f64da04eddd964fcd8bccc959fb1","amp;dn":"Artist%5C%27s+Choice.Sheryl+Crow.%282003%29.l3L%21nK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8822a040da64f64da04eddd964fcd8bccc959fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,34,160,64,218,100,246,77,160,78,221,217,100,252,216,188,204,149,159,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
