I re-designed and re-compiled everything from scratch. This is a project that I have been sharing onbut as luck has it they got shut down the very day I finished it and am ready to upload (Nov 9). So, I?m going to share it everywhere else. This project has really progressed since the first version.\n\nThis requires you to have a DVD burner and a blank DVD. \n\nSo, you may ask what the heck is this thing? Think of it as two discs in one. \n1.\tIt is a Windows XP installer (fully automated and pre-configured)\n2.\tIt is a software installation disc with over 200 pieces of software and over 80 games.\n\nTo give you an idea of what this torrent is like, I made a few high quality screenshots.\nDownload screenshots:\n\nNow on to my usual banter: BURN THIS DISC AT 4X SPEED OR SLOWER! Do not use cheap blank discs. And do not use re-writable media. Use a good, quality name brand media (NOT Memorex). If you don?t follow this advice, this torrent probably won?t come out well. You will probably get a bunch of un-readable sectors and a lot of endless disc spinning and you will think you wasted 4GB of ratio for nothing. Don?t blame me for that. This torrent is good... El Cheap-O blank DVDs are not good! If you tell me you used cheap media or burned it at 16X, I won?t help you. This costs less than $1 and takes 15 minutes to burn. I don?t think that?s so bad considering what you will get?\n\nList of software on this disc:\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nAudacity\nAudioGrabber\nAudioshell\nBonkEnc\nExact Audio Copy\nFlac Drop\nHeadAc3he\nMP3 CD Extractor\nMp3 Splitter\nMp3Tag\nStamp ID3 Tag Editor\nWavePad\n\n[b]Burning[/b]\nAshampoo Burner\nCloneCD\nDP CD/DVD Burner\nEasy DVD Burner\nExpressBurn\nFrog Rights\nISO Burner\nMagic ISO\nNero 6\nPower ISO\nUltimate CD DVD Burner\nUltra ISO\n\n[b]Fun Stuff[/b]\nActivIcons\nAuto Insult\nDesktop Keyboard\nDreamscape Analysis\nFunny Voice\nGames (82 games)\nMind Reader\nPhoto Calendar\nPlus!

There will be a lot of seeders the first couple weeks. Please seed it in the [i]following weeks[/i]? when the swarm of people have grabbed their copy and ran off. If you want to build your ratio, this is the perfect way. I guarantee that seeding this torrent will build your ratio beyond belief. \n\nBy the way, I have tried the beta version of Windows XP?s official service pack 3 and it messed up my design. It removed many of the visual stylings I put in to this project. So, if you like the way this XP looks, don?t install service pack 3 (neither the beta version or when the real deal comes out). Just run the updates and hopefully they won?t ruin the look of the operating system.\n\nIf you install any of this software on a version of XP that is English, it many things won?t show up in the Start Menu. However, if you choose to place an icon on the desktop, it will show up and you will be able to use the software.\n\nI would like to give thanks to LoCorrecto for providing the Office XP Lite software. \n\nEnjoy and please help seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4115ff8da3667090ce6e7fb8bf7b4acd6632d9f","amp;dn":"Mega+Apps+Hybrid+DVD+3.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4115ff8da3667090ce6e7fb8bf7b4acd6632d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,17,95,248,218,54,103,9,12,230,231,251,139,247,180,172,214,99,45,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
