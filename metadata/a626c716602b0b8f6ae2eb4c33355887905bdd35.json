Set in the 19th century, China is in the process of being overrun and divided up by foreign colonial powers. Western ideas and influences are slowly infiltrating the East, while many of the Chinese flock to the west in pursuit of gold.

This earns him the emnity of various forces, including foreign imperialists, collaborating Chinese authorities, extortionist thugs, and a rival martial arts master.
