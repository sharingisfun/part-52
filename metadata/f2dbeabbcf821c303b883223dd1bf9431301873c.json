Police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London?s top cop. This tough law enforcer is good at his job ? so good, in fact, that he makes his colleagues look bad. As a result, his superiors ?promote? him to the village of Sandford, where all is garden parties and neighborhood watch meetings. Partnered with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), an oafish but well-meaning young local cop, Angel struggles to adapt. But he just can?t?until a series of grisly ?accidents? indicates that foul play is afoot. Suddenly, this seemingly idyllic town is a case that Angel has to crack ? hard.\n\n\nDIRECTOR: Edgar Wright\nSTUDIO: Rogue Pictures\nRATING: R (For violent content including some graphic images, and language.)\nGENRE: Comedy\n\n\n\nHot Fuzz\n\nHDTV 1920 x 1072\nStereo - Dolby Digital\nSpoken Language English - Directors Comments\nSubtitles - English - Directors Comments\n\n\nAppleJax Presentations - 2007 - ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2dbeabbcf821c303b883223dd1bf9431301873c","amp;dn":"Hot+Fuzz-HDTV-English-Subtitles-AppleJax-iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2dbeabbcf821c303b883223dd1bf9431301873c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,219,234,187,207,130,28,48,59,136,50,35,221,27,249,67,19,1,135,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
