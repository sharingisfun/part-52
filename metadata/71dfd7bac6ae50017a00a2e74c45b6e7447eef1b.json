Think of it as almost a blend of X-Files and Saved By The Bell. The show is made by Soup 2 Nuts, the creators of Home Movies. They both have a lot in common, like their outlandish plots and obscure humour(much of the script is improvised giving the show a real candid feel and gives the comedy a layer of depth and subtlety which makes it very re-watchable).\nIMDB Link: http://imdb.com/title/tt0423705/\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01 - Sweats\nS1E02 - Clones\nS1E03 - Party Gong\nS1E04 - O&amp;#039;Grady Idol\nS1E05 - Magnets\nS1E06 - Signs\nS1E07 - Bubbleheads\nS1E08 - Robo-Babies\nS1E09 - Cop &amp;#039;Stache\nS1E10 - Sugar Hill\nS1E11 - Old Cold\nS1E12 - No Pain, No Gain\nS1E13 - Remotes\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS2E01 - Frenched\nS2E02 - Vacation\nS2E03 - Big Jerk on Campus\nS2E04 - The Fly\nS2E05 - A Stronger O&amp;#039;Grady\nS2E06 - Cut the Cord\n\n[Episode Guide Included.]\n\nMore action from Operation Massive Information Leak, Wave 1.\nBloodLogic\nWhy I Fight: http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/capstate.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71dfd7bac6ae50017a00a2e74c45b6e7447eef1b","amp;dn":"O%5C%27Grady+-+Seasons+1%2C+2%2C+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71dfd7bac6ae50017a00a2e74c45b6e7447eef1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,223,215,186,198,174,80,1,122,0,162,231,76,69,182,231,68,126,239,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
