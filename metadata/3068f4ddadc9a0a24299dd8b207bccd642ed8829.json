A religious leader who traces his ancestry back to the Prophet Muhammad, he struggles to balance the ancient with the modern.\n\nThe Aga Khan is the spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims, a Shi&amp;#039;ite sect with some 15 million followers around the world. At a time when Islam is at odds with itself and with the West, the Aga Khan represents a voice of moderation, speaking out for pluralism and diversity, and promoting dialogue between civilizations.\n\nBut will he be heard?\n\nVisionTV presents the Canadian television premiere of The Aga Khan: A Voice of Reason, an hour-long documentary profile of this remarkable figure, who in 2007 celebrated the 50th anniversary of his ascension.\n\nThe Ismailis are a people without a homeland. An oft-persecuted minority within Islam, they are scattered across more than 30 countries.\n\nIt was the current Aga KhanÃƒÂ¢??s grandfather, Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan, who created the Ismaili community as we know it today. Though a reputation for high living often overshadowed his achievements, he encouraged Ismailis to build modern institutions, promoted the education of women, and built a network of charities, schools and hospitals in the developing world.\n\nHe died in 1957. In his will, he named his 20-year-old grandson, Prince Karim, as his successor, believing that Ismailis needed a leader who had grown up in the modern world ÃƒÂ¢?? an imam for ÃƒÂ¢??the atomic age.ÃƒÂ¢??\n\nThe Aga Khan: A Voice of Reason reveals how this shy and studious young man became one of the worldÃƒÂ¢??s most respected faith leaders, tending to the spiritual lives of his followers while also operating one of the most important aid organizations in the world: the Aga Khan Development Foundation, which employs 70,000 people and invests more than $400 million in development aid every year.\n\nFor the Aga Khan, social improvement, pluralism and intellectual advancement are integral aspects of the Islamic faith. But his message is being drowned out by the rise of militant fundamentalist Islam. He struggles to act as a force for moderation, and to establish bridges between Islam and the West. But it remains to be seen if this battle can be won.\n\nThe Aga Khan: A Voice of Reason is a Canada-UK production. The film features a rare interview with the Aga Khan, along with seldom-seen archival footage and expert commentary from religious scholars, political leaders and prominent Ismailis, including Conservative MP Rahim Jaffer, CanadaÃƒÂ¢??s first Muslim Member of Parliament.\n\nThe documentary includes a memorable account of the Ismaili exodus from Idi AminÃƒÂ¢??s Uganda in 1972. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau answered the Aga KhanÃƒÂ¢??s call at the time and granted asylum in this country to some 6,000 Ugandan Ismaili refugees.\n\nThe Aga Khan: A Voice of Reason was written and produced by Bill Cran. Shamir Allibhai also produced. It was directed by Cran, Allibhai and Jane Chablani. The executive producers are Andrea Nemtin, Clive Syddall and Bill Nemtin. Joan Jenkinson is the executive producer for VisionTV.\n\nFor information on the Aga Khan Foundation Canada, please visit www.akfc.ca.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3068f4ddadc9a0a24299dd8b207bccd642ed8829","amp;dn":"The+Aga+Khan%3A+A+Voice+Of+Reason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3068f4ddadc9a0a24299dd8b207bccd642ed8829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,104,244,221,173,201,160,162,66,153,221,139,32,123,204,214,66,237,136,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
