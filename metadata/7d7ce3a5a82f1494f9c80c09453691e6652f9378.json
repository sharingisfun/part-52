Pennebaker. It features David Bowie and his backing group The Spiders from Mars performing at the Hammersmith Odeon, July 3rd 1973.\n\nBowie had taken the stage persona of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, a science fiction based, theatrical, enigmatic, androgynous bisexual character and produced two albums during this period. This evening was the last show in the concert tour promoting Bowie&amp;#039;s 1973 album Aladdin Sane and the 60th gig in a tour of Britain that started on May 12th.\n\nAt the end of the evening, aptly just before the song &quot;Rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Roll Suicide&quot;, Bowie announced that, Not only is this is it the last show of the tour, but it&amp;#039;s the last show that we&amp;#039;ll ever do. To the audience it was unclear whether he meant as Bowie or as Ziggy but he had at that moment killed off his Ziggy persona.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7ce3a5a82f1494f9c80c09453691e6652f9378","amp;dn":"Ziggy+Stardust+-+The+Motion+Picture.DVDrip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7ce3a5a82f1494f9c80c09453691e6652f9378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,124,227,165,168,47,20,148,249,200,12,9,69,54,145,230,101,47,147,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
