You&amp;#039;ll take the role of one of the soldiers, investigating what is at first simply the case of an escaped convict who has some unusual dietary tendencies. From there, the fit quickly hits the shan, and you&amp;#039;ll find yourself knee-deep in a tragic, ghostly conspiracy. Sometimes it resembles Resident Evil, other times Fatal Frame. But FEAR stands on its own as a challenging and nuanced experience that I think is one of the best shooters this year.\n\nThis is an Alcohol 120% Clone, crack included in the image.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d40300f7480b6abcb5f56d411e3c251c8f6ab8","amp;dn":"F.E.A.R.+-+%5Byahaa.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d40300f7480b6abcb5f56d411e3c251c8f6ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,212,3,0,247,72,11,106,188,181,245,109,65,30,60,37,28,143,106,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
