Apologies for the inconvenience I have now backed up this one (which is identical to the original seed) and will keep it seeded.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\n&quot;Oz for Africa&quot; benefit concert from the Sydney Entertainment Centre July 12 1985 to support the legendary &quot;Live Aid&quot;\n\nThis copy broadcast by MTV America during the 12/13 July 1985 night\n\nNote the concert has been edited to the best moments. Not a continuous broadcast but almost four hours of footage anyway!\n\nCommercials have been edited out of this DiVx rip\n\n&quot;Sidney&quot; is MTV America's mistake.  Of course we all know that it is spelt &quot;Sydney&quot;\n\nGiven it's age it is far from perfect and grainy - but watchable - and one of the very few copies in existence apart from the master tapes which apparently MTV Australia/Channel 9 do own and are in storage but because of the logistics of getting permission from all bands and the cost involved I doubt we will see it released.  Maybe this bootleg might help.... maybe not.\n\nThis rip is from NTSC VHS source.  Captured and converted to DiVx format for smaller files for downloading.  Some cleanup applied but not very successful.  As mentioned it is still watchable and all we have of this historic concert at this point in time.  If you have access to better than this then please seed it!\n\n\nFile #1\n\n    *Mental as Anything\n          o Live It Up\n          o If You Leave, Can I Come Too?\n          o You're So Strong \n    *Machinations\n          o Pressure Sway\n          o My Heart's On Fire\n          o No Say In It \n    *I'm Talking\n          o Lead the Way \n    *Models\n          o Big On Love\n          o I Hear Motion\n          o Stormy Tonight\n          o Out of Mind, Out of Sight \n    *Do.Re.Mi\n          o Man Overboard\n          o Warnings Moving Clockwise\n          o &quot;Believer&quot; \n    *Electric Pandas\n          o Missing Me\n          o Let's Gamble \n    *Dragon\n          o Speak No Evil\n          o Rain\n          o Are You Old Enough \n    *Men at Work\n          o Maria\n          o Overkill\n          o The Longest Night \n    *Australian Crawl\n          o Reckless (Don't Be So)\n          o Two Can Play\n          o The Boys Light Up \n\nFile #2\n\n    *Party Girls\n          o I Don't Want to be Like You (never alone again / unconfirmed title) \n    *Uncanny X-Men\n          o Everybody Wants to Work (satellite dropout)\n          o 50 Years \n    *Goanna\n          o Common Ground\n          o Song for Africa\n          o Solid Rock \n    *Little River Band\n          o Don't Blame Me\n          o Full Circle\n          o Night Owls\n          o Playing to win \n    *Mondo Rock\n          o Cool World \n          o the Moment\n          o Modern Bop\n          o Come Said the Boy \n    *The Angels (called &quot;Angel City&quot; in the USA)\n          o Small Price\n          o Eat City\n          o Underground\n          o Take a Long Line \n    *Ren&amp;eacute;e Geyer\n          o Put a Little Love in Your Heart\n          o All My love (All Night Long / unconfirmed tittle)\n          o Tell Iy Like It Is (unconfirmed tittle) \n    *INXS\n          o Original Sin\n          o Listen Like Theives\n          o Kiss the Dirt\n          o Don't Change\n          o What You Need\n\n\n**** For more missing &quot;Live Aid&quot; footage check out this torrent on The Pirate Bay too:\n\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/torrents-details.php?id=3279100&amp;hit=1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8c812aa6af894fdec43758a5898693115b0150","amp;dn":"Live+Aid+%5C%22Oz+For+Africa%5C%22+1985+Australian+Concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8c812aa6af894fdec43758a5898693115b0150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,140,129,42,166,175,137,79,222,196,55,88,165,137,134,147,17,91,1,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
