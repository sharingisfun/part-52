In Ireland, there is a section of the Gaeltacht in the general area of Donegal which has again given to Irish music all out of proportion to her size. From this region hail the Brennans and Duggans of Clannad, as well as Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh, the lead voice of Altan. Out of Ranafast in the same area are the musical Ni Dhomhnaills (Micheal, Mairead and Triona) and Aoife Ni Fhearraigh.\n\n(by Gilbert Head)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b1c42ef4cb33bdc9908b7bf3df9ce2f31b3a5df","amp;dn":"Aoife+Ni+Fhearraigh+-+Loinneog+Cheoil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b1c42ef4cb33bdc9908b7bf3df9ce2f31b3a5df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,28,66,239,76,179,59,220,153,8,183,191,61,249,206,47,49,179,165,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
