Politicians and decision makers offer their views on the \nissues, and a new understanding of the labyrinth of conflict in the \nregion is brought to light.\n\nPart 1 of 2 - No Partner\n\nIn May 2000 Israel withdrew from Lebanon. In October 2000 the second\nintifada broke out, following the complete failure of peace talks\nbetween the Israelis and the Palestinians. This film follows and\nanalyses the events from that time up until today. Speaking with\npoliticians, decision makers and leading players in the making of\nthis phase of history, this film goes behind doors into the arena of\nthe making of policies. It follows the radicalisation in the West\nBank and Gaza, and the death of the Israeli Peace Camp; the\nDisengagement of the Gaza strip and the rise of Hamas to government.\nIt chronicles the process, and explains it. This episode starts with\nthe Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 and takes us through\nseveral phases up to the besieging of the Palestinian National\nAuthority compound in Ramallah in 2002. \n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Israel - Years of Blood Part 1o2 (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 499 MB (or 511,184 KB or 523,452,416 bytes)\nFrames.......: 576x432 (1.33:1) [=4:3] @ 0.208 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1293 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e51cf3a1d38b1ebd726eabdfcc56d5b5d1c6a9fd","amp;dn":"Israel+-+Years+of+Blood+Part+1o2+%282006-TVRip-d0x%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e51cf3a1d38b1ebd726eabdfcc56d5b5d1c6a9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,28,243,161,211,139,30,189,114,110,171,223,204,86,213,181,209,198,169,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
