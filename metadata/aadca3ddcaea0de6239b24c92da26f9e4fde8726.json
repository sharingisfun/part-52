Miss Piggy, whether skating on roller skates borrowed from Gregory Hines, fuming with jealousy, or looking lovely and plump in lavender, steals every scene, while good guy/frog Kermit captures viewersÃƒÂ¢?? hearts.\n\nWhen the Muppets come to Broadway to find a producer for their musical, disappointment is the only result. Discouraged, the gang leaves New York and goes its separate ways while Kermit, his dream still alive, continues the search for a producer. With the help of a pack of rats who cook at a diner, Kermit signs up an enthusiastic producer and calls his friends back to New York. But when Kermit disappears before the musical opens, the rest of the Muppets must decide whether the show must go on.\n\nSongs about working for one&amp;#039;s dreams and the importance of friendship send upbeat messages to kids while parents will appreciate the good-humored jabs at the showbiz industry and the cameo appearances by Liza Minnelli, Joan Rivers, and Ed Koch, among many others.\n\nAÃƒÆ’?O: 1984\n\nDIRECTOR: Frank Oz\n\nINTÃƒÆ’?RPRETES: The Muppets, Art Carney, James Coco, Dabney Coleman, Gregory Hines, Linda Lavin, Joan Rivers, Elliott Gould, Liza Minnelli, Brooke Shields\n\nDURACIÃƒÆ’?N: 91 min\n\nGÃƒÆ’?NERO: Comedia\n\nAUDIO: Dolby Digital: Spanish, English, FrancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, German\n\nSUBTITLES: English, FrancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, German, Pole, Czech, Hungarian, Hindu, Turk, Danish, Arabic, Swedish, Finnish, Icelandic, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Greek, Hebrew, Spanish.\n\nSISTEMA: PAL\nRELACION DE ASPECTO: Widescreen 1.85:1 , 16:9\nFORMATO: DVD5 =&gt; DVD5\n\nCOMPRESIÃƒÆ’?N: Sin CompresiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n.
