Divided in two parts, &quot;Part I&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;. Swedish television jumped between their two channels during this event. It's not easy to make these DVDs out of four large mpeg-files. And on top of that they changed channel in the middle of songs. \n\nI had to make a transition in a Black Eyed Peas song (Where is the love). It looks good. \n\nYou can start with Part I and then watch Part II. It works on my Pioneer DV-470.\n\n\nArtist (songs):\n\nGreen Day (4)\nStereophonics (2)\nREM (2)\nTim McGraw (1)\nCraig David &amp; Tina Arena (1)\nTravis (1) cracking sound in middle of song - not my fault\nBlack Eyed Peas (3) \nAudioslave (1)\nKeane (2)\nBryan Adams (2)\nThe Boomtown Rats (1)\n\nI think this DVD is good if you like rock music. But next disc maybe better with Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Bon Jovi, Destinys Child, Brian Wilson and Annie Lennox and some more. It's finished but I seed disc 2 first. Maybe this disc 3 will be up this weekend.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fe00087c3cbf88152ade194a25b5f23d18007ab","amp;dn":"LIVE_8_DVD_DISC_2_by_Ritsch.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fe00087c3cbf88152ade194a25b5f23d18007ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,224,0,135,195,203,248,129,82,173,225,148,162,91,95,35,209,128,7,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
