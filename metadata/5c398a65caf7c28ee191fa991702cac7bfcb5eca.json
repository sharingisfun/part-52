More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\nEpisode 019: Panoramas!\n\nJoseph, also known as BlueMojo, has made a screenrecording about the panorama software Hugin. And of course I had to try it too!\n\nI installed Hugin on Ubuntu 7.10 - I?ll post some quirks I had to circumvert later. Then I went out on to my street and shot a series while I turned 360Ã‚Â°. I followed Josep?s advice and set exposure, white balance and focus to manual.\n\nHere are some links for you to explore:\n\n    * The files from Joseph and me for download are linked in the next post. There is a feed problem.\n    * The Hugin project homepage.\n    * Wikipedia entry about panoramas with some excellent examples. Including the chinese drawing from the show.\n    * A blog entry about shooting panoramas on a site about linux and photography. The blog is worth to explore and there is more to come.\n    * A list of all the Lottofeen in the German TV. ;-)\n\nAnd here is your challenge: Make a panorama with Hugin (or another Open Source Software) and put it into the meetthegimp.org photogroup at 23. On (or after) Friday Dec. 14 I?ll ask a guest to draw one of the entries in a pure scientifically randomized way. ;-) The winner will get a code for a year of ?plus? membership at 23 (value 20?). And in the last show before Christmas I?ll show all the images in a special last 2007 episode.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c398a65caf7c28ee191fa991702cac7bfcb5eca","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_019_Panorama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c398a65caf7c28ee191fa991702cac7bfcb5eca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,57,138,101,202,247,194,142,225,145,250,153,23,2,202,199,191,203,94,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
