Nevertheless, when the architect of the duo, Jan Berry, was incapacitated in early 1966 by a terrible car accident that ultimately left him brain-damaged, Dean Torrence took up the business and musical reins of the band and made a nearly convincing one-shot stab at progressive pop with Save for a Rainy Day. In a sense, the album is still more commercial acquiescence than legitimate artistic statement, yet it is perhaps the most interesting musical stretch in the duo&amp;#039;s catalog ÃƒÂ¢?? although it is a Jan &amp; Dean album in name only rather than in practice, as Berry understandably does not appear on the album in any capacity. The album is conceptual, in the loosest sense of the word, in that each song is about or refers to rain and is held together like a song cycle by thunderstorm sound effects. In addition, most of the tracks were also created by Joe Osborne and Larry Knetchel, as well as another of Torrence&amp;#039;s friends and neighbors, James Burton. As opposed to an opulent studio creation, however, most of Save for a Rainy Day was stitched together in Osborne&amp;#039;s garage. Jan &amp; Dean&amp;#039;s version of Gary Zekley&amp;#039;s &quot;Yellow Balloon&quot; uses the very same backing track that Zekley made for the group Yellow Balloon, and is nearly as good as that version, while &quot;Lullaby in the Rain&quot; is a heartbreakingly pensive hymn. On the other hand, the music occasionally dips into uncomfortably sappy sentiment and easy listening sounds. Nevertheless, the album really is a lovely Californian artifact and worthy blue afternoon listen. [The Sundazed reissue nearly doubles the length of the original album with bonus cuts, most of them instrumental tracks and stereo versions of the album songs, and includes typically definitive liner notes, although the authors have a tendency to wax excessively rhapsodic about the music inside.] (amg)\n\nTracks:\n\n \n 1  Yellow Balloon [*/version]  Lee, St. John, Zekley  2:48  \n 2  Here Comes the Rain [*/version]  Ormsby  2:34  \n 3  Lullaby in the Rain [*/version]  Ormsby  1:56  \n 4  Taste of Rain [*/version]  Ormsby  3:38  \n 5  Yellow Balloon  Lee, Saint John, Zekley  2:27  \n 6  Here Comes the Rain  Ormsby  2:19  \n 7  Pocket Full of Rainbows  Weisman, Wise  2:59  \n 8  When Sunny Gets Blue  Fisher, Segal  3:04  \n 9  Like a Summer Rain  Dean, Zekley  2:54  \n10  Raindrops  Clark  2:40  \n11  Rain on the Roof  Sebastian  2:25  \n12  Cryin&amp;#039; in the Rain  Greenfield, King  1:54  \n13  Taste of Rain  Ormsby  3:30  \n14  Save for a Rainy Day Theme  Knechtel  2:44  \n15  Yellow Balloon [*/version]  Lee, St. John, Zekley  2:44  \n16  Taste of Rain [*/version]  Ormsby  3:44  \n17  Rain Clouds Long Gone [#/*/instrumental]  Ormsby  2:56  \n18  When Sunny Gets Blue [#/*/instrumental/version]  Fisher, Segal  2:56  \n19  Pocket Full of Rainbows [*/version]  Weisman, Wise  3:04  \n20  Rain on the Roof [*/version]  Sebastian  2:24  \n21  Yellow Balloon [#/*/instrumental/version]  Lee, St. John, Zekley  2:50  \n22  Taste of Rain [#/*/instrumental/version]  Ormsby  3:17  \n23  Save for a Rainy Day Theme [*/version]  Knechtel  2:44  \n\n\nSMiLES!\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977efe91ad364b36ce04ab3d55c8760ab461c6b8","amp;dn":"Jan+%26+Dean+-+Save+For+A+Rainy+Day+-+mono%2Fstereo+-+with+bonus+tra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977efe91ad364b36ce04ab3d55c8760ab461c6b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,126,254,145,173,54,75,54,206,4,171,61,85,200,118,10,180,97,198,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
