The object of the game is to\nidentify poker hands within a deck of cards that has been dealt\nand evenly spread out face up. Once a hand has been marked to\nplay, the cards that make up the hand are removed, points are\nawarded, and any cards above them fall down to take their place.\n(The game&amp;#039;s screen shot shows an example of the concept).\n\nVersion 4.3.2 enhances the Player Selection Screen so that\nnovice players are given instructions about how to select a\nplayer and begin a new game.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261c13e0c5aaca04bcd1d70a0810d30a36a72c2f","amp;dn":"Poker+Challenge+4.3.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261c13e0c5aaca04bcd1d70a0810d30a36a72c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,28,19,224,197,170,202,4,188,209,215,10,8,16,211,10,54,167,44,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
