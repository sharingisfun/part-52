Two releases were made before the band decided to\ntake some time off to seek inspiration elsewhere. Members of the band lived\nabroad and moved towns but pretty soon felt the urge to return home and do\nwhat they love the most. Back in Sweden they spent almost a year back where\nit all started, in the rehearsel writing music and defining their new sound.\n\nAfter almost two years of scilence, Red Angel Records are proud to present\ntheir debut album \\&quot;Songs of Love and Rebellion\\&quot;. 13 songs of explosive skapunk to fan the flame of discontent. A dedication to the civil rights movements\nof the 21st century. This is Targetpoint at a whole new level, heavy,\nenergetic and with melodies that will have you dancing and singing along to\nthe revolution in no time.\n\n\nHemsida och myspace:\n\nwww.targetpoint.se\n\nwww.myspace.com/targetpointswe\n\n\nTorrentinnehÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥ll:\n\nTargetpoint-Songs_Of_Love_&amp;_Rebellion-2005-ILabs\n\nTarget Point - Bombstrike [2002] MCD\n\nTarget Point - Street Comes Alive [2000]\n\ntargetpoint - Gammal kassettdemo-rip\n\nHar rippat alla utom demon sjÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤lv och de ska ligga pÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥ 192 kbps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eee35fa47bdcb79cff3137eb0459e47565f234e","amp;dn":"Targetpoint+Diskografi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eee35fa47bdcb79cff3137eb0459e47565f234e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,238,53,250,71,189,203,121,207,243,19,126,176,69,158,71,86,95,35,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
