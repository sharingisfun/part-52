She did work with other musicians, most notably, M. Up and coming at the time, Mathieu Chedid was courted by Vanessa after she heard his songs on the radio and loved them... thinking he was a girl. \n\nOther contributors  Frank Langolff, of the M&amp;J and Variations albums, wrote the music for &quot;Commando.&quot; In one of the photos, you can see him touching Van's chin tenderly. Gerry DeVeaux, Lenny Kravitz's cousin, makes another appearance as a lyricist on a Vanessa album, writing for the &quot;La La La Song.&quot; Bruce Witkin plays bass on many songs; he was the bassist for the band Kids back in the eighties, with Johnny Depp on guitar. Johnny Depp wrote the music for &quot;St. Germain&quot; and &quot;Bliss,&quot; and played lead guitar on &quot;Firmaman.&quot; He also photographed Vanessa for the cover, and altered it in Photoshop. &quot;\n\nTracks:\n\n01.
