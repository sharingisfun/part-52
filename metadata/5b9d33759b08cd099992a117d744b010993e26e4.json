Well I just noticed that no matter what I did,XP x64 will not install the M-Audio drivers for this card_nothing new here,I know. Then last night,I dual booted with Xubuntu which required me to install madfudloader and to my great surprised as soon as I booted back into XP,the M-Audio card was instantly recognized and installed automatically!Same thing happens with Leopard,by the way;there are no official drivers but this is a workaround.\nI backed up the drivers that I found in device manager since I believe that maybe they will work as well for someone with a standalone XP(or maybe even Vista x64?) install so they would not have to perform a dual boot Ubuntu install just to get this driver working. I havenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t tested it on a standalone install but I see no reason why it should not work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b9d33759b08cd099992a117d744b010993e26e4","amp;dn":"M-Audio+Mobile-Pre+drivers+XP+64%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b9d33759b08cd099992a117d744b010993e26e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,157,51,117,155,8,205,9,153,146,161,23,215,68,176,16,153,62,38,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
