Similar in style the group these two would form immediately thereafter: Flied Egg (also related in one way or another to: Jacks, Foodbrain, Sadistic Mika Band and Captain Hiro &amp; Space Band). Narumo played guitars and organ, Tsunoda sang and played drums. The sound is a thunderous post-Purple mess of tubs, riffs and blues-approximation. The lyrics are sung in almost-English and most concern the illustrious concerns of &quot;women&quot; (at least they don't seem to use the word &quot;lady&quot;). &quot;I Gotta See My Gypsy Woman&quot; is the first track, &quot;Women Called Yellow 'Z'&quot; is the second, by the time you get to &quot;Mary Jane On My Mind&quot; you'll probably need to empty the tear-bucket.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4503de14be5054991e80674142a767e0a242870d","amp;dn":"Strawberry+Path-+When+the+raven+has+come+to+the+earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4503de14be5054991e80674142a767e0a242870d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,3,222,20,190,80,84,153,30,128,103,65,66,167,103,224,162,66,135,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
