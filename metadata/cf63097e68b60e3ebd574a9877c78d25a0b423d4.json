For Trillian Astra, we spent time discovering why certain controls (a scrollbar, an icon, etc.)\ntook longer to redraw than others and optimized these routines when possible.\nThe differences are measured in milliseconds, but when you&amp;#039;re drawing 60+ user icons in a contact list these sub-second times\ncan be the difference between a quick product and a sluggish one.\n\nNetwork connections are more efficiently managed\nAnother minor detail in speeding things up involves the connections Trillian makes to IM services.\nWith Trillian Astra, the routines to handle both incoming and outgoing data have been heavily\noptimized to ensure a speedy overall IM experience.\n\nMemory usage reduced\nYou spoke, we listened. Trillian Astra represents the ultimate in flexible,\nefficient memory usage; we&amp;#039;ve reduced the amount of memory required for our XML routines by roughly\n5MB and trimmed things here and there whenever possible to decrease footprint further.\nIf pretty graphics aren&amp;#039;t for you, using a barebones skin drops memory usage even further.\n\nMemory leaks plugged\nAs with all releases of Trillian, time has been spent plugging memory leaks wherever they&amp;#039;re found.\n\nSkin variety with memory in mind\nFor the absolute minimalists among us,\nwe&amp;#039;ll be featuring a super stripped-down skin that will barely register in overall memory usage!\nAs well, we&amp;#039;re extending invitations to all current and past skinners to bring their skins into modern Trillian times.\nWe hope to offer as many possibilities as we can by the time our final product is ready,\nincluding various best-of-breed third party skins.\n\n\n(================================================= ============Patch Info============================================== ===================)\n\n1. Unpack the zip to a temporary folder\n2. Install the program using the included installer.\n3. Run the patcher and select the Trillian main executable.\n4.
