The first night was recorded in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The tornado that devastated Oklahoma City was headed right for us the night we were scheduled to begin our ministry at a local church. At first the church leadership wanted to send everyone to a protected area. I suggested, `maybe we could sneak a little worship song in before we head to shelter&amp;iquest;. They agreed and we began to sing the song, They Will Know We Are Christians By Our Love. When we got into the middle of the song I was led to begin speaking directly to that tornado. I did not want to do this because I could not get past the thought of how stupid I would look speaking against this tornado and then, when the song was over, all of us having to run for our lives to shelter. I was afraid that my words - might just be words - absent the power of God to stop that tornado. But while thinking this very thought I found myself already speaking - it was too late to stop. So it surprised me more than anyone else to later learn that, immediately as we started praying, the tornado system mysteriously broke apart. (How weak my faith is!) God literally stopped a tornado that night as we played and prayed. I hope I never forget it. Yes God can stop a natural tornado. But much more importantly, if we would ask, God will stop the spiritual tornadoes that divide us and render us such an anemic force on the earth. My prayer is that we will `come to the water&amp;iquest;, the very love of the Father, and quickly shed the independence that so weakens us. Only then will we be able to take on the radical dependence of a child that was the strength of the early Christians.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a91cb52d3b268a54286954932fa106c391d177f9","amp;dn":"Jason+Upton+-+Remember","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a91cb52d3b268a54286954932fa106c391d177f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,28,181,45,59,38,138,84,40,105,84,147,47,161,6,195,145,209,119,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
