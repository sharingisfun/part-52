Is it suicide? Or is it murder? And who is likely to be next? \n\n6 CDs.\n7hrs 7 mins.\nRAR.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255c10e92aad94dad865505f8f964f75e880cfe5","amp;dn":"MURDER+in+a+Cathedral++Ruth+Dudley+Edwards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255c10e92aad94dad865505f8f964f75e880cfe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,92,16,233,42,173,148,218,216,101,80,95,143,150,79,117,232,128,207,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
