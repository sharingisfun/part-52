He won the Georgia Fiddling competition\nseven times throughout his life time, which goes to show that he must\nhave been one of the best fiddlers in the South dure in the earlier\npart of the 20th century.\n\n--------Fiddlin&amp;#039; John Carson - Volume IV (1925 - 1926)--------\n\nThis music was purchased from Document-Records.co.uk where\nFiddlin&amp;#039; John Carson&amp;#039;s other six volumes can be found, \nenjoy whats here, my favorate/ most recommended songs out of \nthese are &quot;Everybody works but Father&quot;, &quot;Peter went Fishing&quot;,\n&quot;Don&amp;#039;t Let your deal go down&quot; and &quot;Swanee River&quot;. I may upload\nthe other volumes that I have (5, 6 &amp; 7) as I believe that this\nmusic needs to be listened to rather than forgotten in history.\n\n-CoolJack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ecac619b1cdce882541ae0dd19ddf0c3a399a3d","amp;dn":"Fiddlin%5C%27+John+Carson+-+Volume+IV+%281925+-+1926%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ecac619b1cdce882541ae0dd19ddf0c3a399a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,202,198,25,177,205,206,136,37,65,174,13,209,157,223,12,58,57,154,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
