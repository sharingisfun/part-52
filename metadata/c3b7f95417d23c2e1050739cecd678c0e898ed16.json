I really enjoyed their songs, and their cool rhythms. Adjeng's (vocalist) husky yet soothing voice was beautiful along with Sorioso's guitars and vocals.\n\nAlthough they were quite underated when they released their album.. Sipol, I think gave one of the nicest offerings to the Phil music industry last year. If you liked MYMP and Nina Live!, you will probably enjoy this, Unplug and Play.\n\nSix (6) songs are in english, the rest is sang with english and tagalog (taglish).\n\n\nGENRE:\nPop, Acoustic, R&amp;B, and a little Jazzy\n\n\nSIPOL ONLINE:\nhttp://sipolonline.proboards27.com/index.cgi\n\n\nRELATED LINKS:\nhttp://sipolonline.proboards27.com/index.cgi\nhttp://www.friendzy.com/Stories/UserStory.aspx?story=3532\nhttp://www.titikpilipino.com/news/?aid=258\nhttp://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/jul/31/yehey/enter/20040731ent1.html\nhttp://www.awitawards.com.ph/finalists.html\n\n\nTORRENT DETAILS:\nWMA/MP3 Format\n41mb (10 Files)\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\nGive Me One More Chance \nHigher Than High \nHindi Diyos Nagbabago, Tao \nHold On \nIt's Only A Game \nKailanman \nPa'no Nga Ba \nSay It Isn't So \nSweetheart, Tweetums \nTook You For Granted\n\n\nNOTE:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------++\nBe advised that I cannot stay online all the time.\nI may be offline for some hours, so please be patient with the seeding.\n\nPlease help me SEED once you are finished, that'll be nice.\nUpload what you've downloaded at least.
