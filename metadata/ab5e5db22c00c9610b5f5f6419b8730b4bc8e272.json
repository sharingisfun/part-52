Working .CSO File Hint: O=Enter X=Back\n\nAbout the game:\n\n&quot;Popular gaming mainstay Bomberman makes his debut on the PSP with Bomberman Panic Bomber! A puzzle/action game not unlike Tetris, Bomberman Panic Bomber asks players to match bombs of the same color to make them explode and clear space on the playing field. While that gameplay in itself might not seem all that revolutionary, Bomberman Panic Bomber features enough variety to keep even a hardcore gamer occupied! In addition to a COM Attack mode versus the computer, theres a Score Attack, and a Challenge Attack, which features a whopping 50 minigames. Even more, you can connect with up to 3 other players for wireless Bomberman Panic Bomber action, and only 1 of the players needs to own the game! The other 3 can simply operate off that 1 players UMD, making Bomberman Panic Bomber not only fun, but surprisingly economical, too!&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5e5db22c00c9610b5f5f6419b8730b4bc8e272","amp;dn":"PSP+%5BJAP%5D-++Bomberman+Panic+Bomber.+Working+ISO%2FCSO+-Pepsi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5e5db22c00c9610b5f5f6419b8730b4bc8e272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,94,93,178,44,0,201,97,11,95,95,100,25,184,115,11,75,200,226,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
