When the helicopter is destroyed and the passenger&amp;#039;s are killed by accident, the dog is let into the base and the American&amp;#039;s begin to wonder what has actually happened. The helicopter is discovered to be of Norweigan make, and probably linked to the Norweigan base not too far from their own. Helicopter pilot J.R MacReady offers to travel to the Norweigan base and find out what has happened. On arrival, he finds that the place has been totally destroyed. He also discovers a mangled body that looks as though it was once that of a person, which he brings back with him to study. It is only then that the clues begin to add up; the dog morphs horribly into a strange creature that attacks the researchers. They manage to fight it off, but the base&amp;#039;s doctor has come to a conclusion: an alien with the power to transform and take the appearance of anybody else is amongst them. Who is infected already, and who can be trusted? J.R MacReady sets out to find the answers to exactly that.\n\n\nHonestly I&amp;#039;m not sure how this movie got so small. It has a large amount of black and dark back ground that can easily be encoded but the action scenes are still live with motion and color.\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 1.87 Gb\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: The Thing.mkv\nDate: 7/01/2008 11:16:46\nSize: 2,017,378,187 bytes (1923.922 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:48:42 (6522.432 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 7/01/2008 16:13:41 UTC\nNumber of streams: 6\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Commentary}\nType of stream nr. 4: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {English Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {Spanish Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 6: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {French Subtitles}\nAudio streams: 2\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 32\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nFrame aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels (container): 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nMode: 3 front, 2 rear, 1 LFE\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ad2feddfbaab6abd4a24a636c4ca94b9b9b1ee","amp;dn":"The+Thing+HD+720p+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ad2feddfbaab6abd4a24a636c4ca94b9b9b1ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,173,47,237,223,186,171,106,189,74,36,166,54,196,202,148,185,185,177,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
