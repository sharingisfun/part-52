Featuring plenty of sound clips including the first ever &amp;#039;Tron on record and interviews\nwith Paul McCartney and other musicians such as Mike Pinder, who worked at the Mellotron factory before going full time with The Moody Blues.\n\nThis upload is ripped from a cassette recording of the original BBC radio\nbroadcast from January 1998. Sound quality is not hi-fi but clear and listenable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:227f62016da127c467c29364ed644f897f243db5","amp;dn":"Rick+Wakeman+-+The+Mellotron+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"227f62016da127c467c29364ed644f897f243db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,127,98,1,109,161,39,196,103,194,147,100,237,100,79,137,127,36,61,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
