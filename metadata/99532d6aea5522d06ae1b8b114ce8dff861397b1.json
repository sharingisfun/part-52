Secret Agent\n\n\nFacing life without parole for a crime he ultimately didn&amp;#039;t commit, crook Darien Fawkes is offered a pardon if he&amp;#039;ll agree to participate in his brother&amp;#039;s medical experiment: the insertion into his brain of a synthetic gland which secretes a light-bending substance called Quicksilver, which renders whoever or whatever is cloaked in it invisible. But Quicksilver also breaks down Darien&amp;#039;s sanity without the regular injection of a counter-agent, and when terrorists gun down everyone involved in the project and steal all the relevant information, Darien is recruited by the experiment&amp;#039;s backers, an ultra-secret and under-funded intelligence agency subsidized by the Department of Fish and Game, to stop the terrorists, avenge his brother&amp;#039;s death, and get a fresh hit of the counter-agent.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99532d6aea5522d06ae1b8b114ce8dff861397b1","amp;dn":"The+Invisible+Man+DVD+4%2F4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99532d6aea5522d06ae1b8b114ce8dff861397b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,83,45,106,234,85,34,208,106,225,184,177,20,206,141,255,134,19,151,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
