Black Hawk Down stars an exceptional cast including Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Eric Bana (Chopper), Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge), Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan), William Fichtner (The Perfect Storm), Ewen Bremmer (Snatch) and Sam Shepard (All The Pretty Horses).\n\nIn 1993, an elite group of American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are sent to Somalia on a critical mission to capture a violent warlord whose corrupt regime has lead to starvation of hundreds of thousands of Somalis. When the mission goes quickly and terribly wrong, the men find themselves outnumbered and literally fighting for their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd93603e88c053632ad27d5ff2d38688b5a7b4a","amp;dn":"Black+Hawk+Down","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd93603e88c053632ad27d5ff2d38688b5a7b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,217,54,3,232,140,5,54,50,173,39,213,255,45,56,104,139,90,123,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
