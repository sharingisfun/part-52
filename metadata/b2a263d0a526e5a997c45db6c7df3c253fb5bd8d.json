The House Of Blues show from 1996 was \nreleased as a stand alone DVD in 2005, and is now combined in this set with \nthe never before seen show from Club 662 in Las Vegas, also filmed in 1996 on \nthe day of his release from prison. In contrast to the many &quot;story of&quot; DVDs of \nTupac available, this set is the definitive live experience of Tupac at his \nvery best in front of a live audience. \n\nTracklisting \n\nDisc One - House of Blues \n\n1.
