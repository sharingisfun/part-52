We aim to bring you the best bugfixes both Core and Database from other open source communities, as well as providing a flexbile and easy way to create your own personal World of Warcraft Burning Crusade Server.\n\nRequirements:\n- enUS/enGB World of Warcraft Client installed, that&amp;#039;s patched up to 2.2.0\n- 512mb of ram (min)\n- Pentium 4+ Processor (min)\n\nRelease Notes:\nInformation:\n&quot;Unlike previous releases and update formats, we&amp;#039;ve decided to give it our one last stand and try to bring the most stable release for the public once again. The developer team did not feel that MGTPack 1.0 was a hit, and as such, we&amp;#039;ve gone underground for several weeks, only spilling out very little information, doing rigorous testing and fixing to come to this.\n\nMGTPack 1.2\n\nThis post will look much more differently than the traditional update / release post we&amp;#039;ve had in the past. In order to not confuse any newcomers, we&amp;#039;ve decided to merge the core, database, and website feature list into one unified changelog. Don&amp;#039;t worry, it&amp;#039;ll still be in the same order, so you will be able to hint out which is what.\n\nWe&amp;#039;re glad to present you, and this is coming straight from our testers (a big thanks to them of course, because without them, I don&amp;#039;t know in what shape this release would be in), the most stable, working release of MGTPack yet.&quot;\n\nSo, you must be very eager to hear about the release changelog. Unfortunately, there were some features that were not tested, but had been reported as &quot;working&quot;. We&amp;#039;ll keep that in the changelog, under a different highlight to inform you about this, but we are not making any promises. Other than that, the dev team is still very glad to present all the fully tested and working features. Again, a big thanks to our testers for making all of this possible.\n\n// Features that haven&amp;#039;t been tested, but will be in the future release \n\n    * Updated to Ascent rev 3203\n    * Updated to NCDB rev 656\n    * Very stable\n    * Website is 100% working, feel free to check out the Website guide on setting it up (thanks to the entire team effort for this)\n    * New Home Station tool\n          o To replace the BAT files, as well as provide easy descriptions for you to understand the files.

(GMs not affected)\n    * Pet spell targeting remade.

That means the random suffixes, such as &quot;of the boar&quot;, &quot;of the eagle&quot;, and etc.\n          o Halaa Battle Tokens working correctly (I believe tongue.gif)\n    * Spells:\n      This is a SMALL rundown of ALL the spells that were actually fixed up to this point.
