(CDs 2 and 3 below)\nMp3s 256 VBR\n\nCD 1  - lots of tracks from eponymous 1st album and other early classics eg. 1977, Capital Radio One, City of the Dead, White Man In Hammersmith Palais\n\n2 demos (Janie Jones, Career Opportunities)\n2 lives (English Civil War, I Fought the Law)\n\n\nOriginally released in USA, then UK in 1991. Marked the beginning of the rehabilitation of the band. Came with a great booklet with terrific Pennie Smith photos and notes from the band, and also lyric book. Well worth looking for in 2nd hand shops etc if you\\&amp;#039;re a big Clash fan or want to see where U2 nicked all their ideas from. I think a crappy smaller version in a CD sized box is also kicking around.\n\nEnjoy and plant a tree for Joe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4015660/Clash_on_Broadway_CDs_2_and_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4015660/Clash_on_Broadway_CDs_2_and_3&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d9ac8f15ed1ef49dd99c06c1d8fb4701738eef","amp;dn":"Clash+on+Broadway+CD+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d9ac8f15ed1ef49dd99c06c1d8fb4701738eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,217,172,143,21,237,30,244,157,217,156,6,193,216,251,71,1,115,142,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
