From a thousand\nothers trained as child warriors in 1966, he is now, he believes, only one of 20 left\nalive to tell the story.\n\nIn his powerful and compelling testimony for the camera -- one of the most extraordinary\nwe have ever heard -- Duncan describes: -- His mission to &quot;terminate&quot; the very drunk,\nfuture President of the United States... George W Bush;\n\n-- His dizzying enhanced physical and psychic abilities... including the abilities to\nhurl someone across the room with his mind, and walk through a solid wall;\n\n-- How he and 11 other children were flown to Cambodia to deliver a targeted death blow\nto all the surrounding Khmer Rouge troops... using only the combined power of their\nminds;\n\n-- How his right arm is &quot;hardwired&quot; and is capable of astonishing speed and strength;\n\n-- His struggle to regain his memory, aided by a car accident which led to the discovery\nof a cranial implant uncovered by an MRI machine... deactivating the implant and causing\nthe MRI machine to catch fire;\n\n-- His role as a programmed assassin, targeting Americans under the command of an\nundisclosed agency;\n\n-- The selection, torture, and brutal training process that he endured... and which\nchildren are undergoing to this day;\n\n-- And more...\n\nTwenty years later, Duncan (who is of mixed Cherokee and Irish blood) comes forward to\ntell the truth about the Ultimate Warrior project: how he was chosen, groomed and\ntortured into becoming the perfect fighting machine, combining physical superiority with\nthe extraordinary mental abilities of a psychic spy.\n\nFearless, principled, and determined to regain control over his life, Duncan O&amp;#039;Finioan\ntells his story in detail.

An overview is presented, giving details of the\nstory. These details feature a Southeast Asian mind weapon experiment, in which many\nKhmer Rouge troops were killed by a group of children without the use of weapons. The\nchildren reportedly used their psychically linked minds as a lethal weapon.\nThis program examines the truth of the subject matter, with comments offered by a\ngovernment operative, who should be aware of such experiments and who could corroborate\nthe eyewitness accounts of both Corso and O&amp;#039;Finioan.\n\nIf you have further email questions, send them to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;98f2fdeaeae1d8f2fdeaeae1e8f1e8e8f1f6b6fbf7f5b6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n* Red Ice Radio 2007-02-08 Duncan O&amp;#039;Finioan\n\nRobert Duncan O&amp;#039;Finioan - Super Soldier\nFebruary 8, 2007\n\nWe are joined by former &quot;Super Soldier&quot; Duncan O&amp;#039;finioan to talk about his experiences.\nDuncan was first taken at the age of six and has no memories until he&amp;#039;s nine years old.\nDuncan has been taken on sporadic occasions thru out his life to be trained by either a\nfaction working within or above the US military, very likely a black budget program that\nare training and &quot;developing&quot; what is known as Super Soldiers. We talk about Duncan&amp;#039;s\nmemories and the horrendous conditions of his training. We also talk about mind control,\nprogramming techniques, the future and Duncan&amp;#039;s goals and we also speculate around who\ncould be behind these kinds of activities and towards the end we get into a very\ninteresting connection with the planet Mars.
