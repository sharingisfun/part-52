I`ve noticed that a lot of good movies have slipped through the cracks of the ripping community. Some movies are no where to be found. If you are an avid movie collector, like myself, than you know exactly what I`m talking about. I am dedicated to bringing you all the good movies that you just can`t seem to find, so you can fill those unseemly holes in your collection.\nWhen it comes to quality, I have one golden rule: If I wouldn`t put it in my own collection, than I wouldn`t post it. \n\nInformation \n\nTitle...........[ The Escapist\nDirector........[ Gillies MacKinnon\nLanguage........[ English \nRuntime.........[ 1:30:29\nGenre...........[ Action \nIMDB Rating.....[ 6.1/10 http://imdb.com/title/tt0299854/\nVideo...........[ Xvid 890 Kbps 23.976 fps \nAudio...........[ Dolby Digital AC3 6ch 128 Kbps \nResolution......[ 720 x 400 \nSubtitles.......[ None \nFile Size.......[ 786 MB \nSource..........[ Retail DVD NTSC \n\nCast \n\nJonny Lee Miller.....Denis Hopkins \nAndy Serkis..........Ricky Barnes \nGary Lewis...........Ron \nJodhi May............Christine \nPaloma Baeza.........Valerie Hopkins \nVas Blackwood........Vin \nPhilip Barantini.....Joey \n\nPlot\n\nThe skilled pilot Denis Hopkins loves with his pregnant wife Valerie and has a comfortable lifestyle.
