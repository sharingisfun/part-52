The film begins when two members of The Yes Men, Andy and Mike, set up a website that mimics the World Trade Organization&amp;#039;s--and it&amp;#039;s mistaken for the real thing. They play along with the ruse and soon find themselves invited to important functions as WTO representatives. Delighted to represent the organization they politically oppose, Andy and Mike don thrift-store suits and set out to shock unwitting audiences with darkly comic satire that highlights the worst aspects of global free trade.\n\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379593/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 1.15 GB\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: The Yes Men.mkv\nDate: 16/01/2008 08:44:38\nSize: 1,245,608,795 bytes (1187.905 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:22:02 (4921.856 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 16/01/2008 13:42:43 UTC\nNumber of streams: 9\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Commentary}\nType of stream nr. 4: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 6: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 7: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 8: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 9: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nAudio streams: 2\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 720 x 464\nWidth: multiple of 16\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 720 x 464\nFrame aspect ratio: 45:29 = 1.551724\nPixel aspect ratio: 871:720 = 1.209722\nDisplay aspect ratio: 871:464 = 1.877155 (~1.85:1)\nFramerate: 23.976024 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392907297bc0fe8659b17780a89f40a10ace8323","amp;dn":"The+Yes+Men+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392907297bc0fe8659b17780a89f40a10ace8323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,41,7,41,123,192,254,134,89,177,119,128,168,159,64,161,10,206,131,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
