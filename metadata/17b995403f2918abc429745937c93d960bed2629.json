You'll be able to choose A.E.U.G. or Titans before you head into battle. Seven years after the end of the devastating One Year War: The victorious Earth Federation has become corrupt and oppressive, and the elite Titans police force has taken on dictatorial powers. As the A.E.U.G. rebel group struggles to defeat the Titans, the heroes and villains of the original Mobile Suit Gundam series find themselves on the same side of this new conflict. The focus, however, is on a new hero named Kamille Bidan, the pilot of the transforming Zeta Gundam.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b995403f2918abc429745937c93d960bed2629","amp;dn":"PS2DVD+-+Mobile+Suit+Gundam+vs+Zeta+USA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b995403f2918abc429745937c93d960bed2629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,185,149,64,63,41,24,171,196,41,116,89,55,201,61,150,11,237,38,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
