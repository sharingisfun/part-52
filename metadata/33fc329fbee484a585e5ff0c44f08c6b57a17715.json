Krubrick is suspected to have requested selections from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Atom Heart Mother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; but obviously, Floyd turned him down. Roger Waters had been quotes as saying that this was one of the few career moves he ever made that he \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;truly regretted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. 2001 was released in 1968, and Meddle was released in 1971.--\n\n   Both the song and final chapter line up perfectly being 24min. a piece. I lined up the first \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;ping\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; from the Echos song and the chapter title appearence. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s pretty clean and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did the first time I saw it!!!\n\ntHnX,\n  ~:P1zL3:~\n\nPS: It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s wmv which is kind of a pain, but hey, it works great in media player!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33fc329fbee484a585e5ff0c44f08c6b57a17715","amp;dn":"2001%3A+a+floyd+odessey+%28synced+2k1+and+Pink+Floyd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33fc329fbee484a585e5ff0c44f08c6b57a17715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,252,50,159,190,228,132,165,133,229,255,12,68,240,140,107,87,161,119,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
