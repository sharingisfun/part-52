Mo Murphy shows his pedigree with charivari, followed by the 'Childs' showing off their euph. kung-fu.  Hear Bog Flusher get completely outclassed by Gordon Campbell, Gay Biker should have stayed at home.  Ends with Derek 'the daddy' Watkins 'warming-up' for a couple of numbers, ending his 'set' with 'We've Only Just Begun'.  He finally lets you 'AVE IT, singing out on a 'dubba B'!  If you listen carefully you should be able to hear the front-row cornets quietly sobbing as they nurse their bleeding ears.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7498b66b0e8ace3b899abf20881fd6d871d1ef4","amp;dn":"Grimethorpe+Collery+Band+-+Stars+in+Brass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7498b66b0e8ace3b899abf20881fd6d871d1ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,73,139,102,176,232,172,227,184,153,171,242,8,129,253,109,135,29,30,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
