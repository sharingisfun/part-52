T.K. (leader of the Urban Maulerz) makes his introduction and offers the player to race him. The challenger gives the player a Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX (from his crew garage)and you race T.K&amp;#039;s Mazda RX-8. However, before the race starts, you place a bet with T.K. When the bet is set you race. After the race (win or lose) race winnings and the bet pool goes to the winner, T.K. makes the player a Juiced racer and gives the player a choice of any three tuner cars to offer so he can keep his own car. T.K gives the player a garage and his own mechanic(so he can customize a car). After that, T.K. gives you his phone number and tells the player about entering events and upgrades, then leaves you. The player learns about the Juiced races(being a little weird than other street races). The player races through a series of races, with other crews in Angel City, unlocking rewards, meeting new crews and earning their respect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0873e4ea4f548b4b1c1398c4b8f53a4e5c9167f","amp;dn":"Juiced+%28Buka%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0873e4ea4f548b4b1c1398c4b8f53a4e5c9167f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,135,62,78,164,245,72,180,177,193,57,140,75,143,83,164,229,201,22,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
