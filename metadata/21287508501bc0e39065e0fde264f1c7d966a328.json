He\\&amp;#039;s so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel\\&amp;#039;s superiors send him to a place where his talents won\\&amp;#039;t be quite so embarrassing - the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.\n\nHowever, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny\\&amp;#039;s dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality. It\\&amp;#039;s time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.\n\n-samZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21287508501bc0e39065e0fde264f1c7d966a328","amp;dn":"Hot.Fuzz%282007%29DVDrip-samZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21287508501bc0e39065e0fde264f1c7d966a328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,40,117,8,80,27,192,227,144,101,224,253,226,100,241,199,217,102,163,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
