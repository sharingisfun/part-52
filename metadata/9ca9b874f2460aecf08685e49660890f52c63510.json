I don&amp;#039;t know if it&amp;#039;s legit, bur I guess you&amp;#039;ll have to find that out on your own lonesome. I don&amp;#039;t have Windows Vista so there was no purpose in me even bothering to download this. I have too many files that need to be downloaded and I just didn&amp;#039;t need this extra one taking up bandwidth. So go on and try it out yourself. I don&amp;#039;t have any serials for this either so you have to find one yourself. If it&amp;#039;s the real thing, then I hope you guys can use this up to it&amp;#039;s fullest and make some awesome games. if it&amp;#039;s not the real thing then please post a comment saying so so I can look harder and try to find this thing. When I get a Vista PC, this is definitely the first application getting installed. Right after uTorrent ;) And if you&amp;#039;re reading this around Christmas time, then Merry Christmas and have a happy new year. Enjoy people! And please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca9b874f2460aecf08685e49660890f52c63510","amp;dn":"FPS+Creator+X10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca9b874f2460aecf08685e49660890f52c63510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,169,184,116,242,70,10,236,240,134,133,228,150,96,137,15,82,198,53,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
