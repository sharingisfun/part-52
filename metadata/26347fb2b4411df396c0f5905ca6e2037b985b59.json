Leonard Bernstein conducted &quot;Beethoven&amp;#039;s: Symphony No. 9&quot;. In celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall. In this Version Joy(Freude), is replaced by Freedom(Freiheit) for the occasion.\n\nThis is a VIDEO of the 9?Th in its entirety. The Video Quality is 6.5/10 watchable, the sound a good 9/10.\n\nIf you don?t get a chance to see the 9?Th in person this Christmas season then having the video is a must, I watch it with good frequency. The performance is inspiring and very emotional as one of Bernstein?s last performances (Having died in 1990).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26347fb2b4411df396c0f5905ca6e2037b985b59","amp;dn":"Beethoven+9%5C%27th+VIDEO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26347fb2b4411df396c0f5905ca6e2037b985b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,52,127,178,180,65,29,243,150,192,245,144,92,166,226,3,123,152,91,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
