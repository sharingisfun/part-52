Hit The Deck - 6.10  ------------------------------------------------------------ Lipps Inc(pronounced like &quot;lip sync&quot;) was a studio band that achieved one significant hit, &quot;Funkytown&quot; in 1980. The song is considered, by some, the last disco song to hit #1 in the U.S.\n\nThe group was formed in Minneapolis by Steven Greenberg, who wrote and produced all of the group's music, and who also played several musical instruments. The lead singer was Cynthia Johnson, and the rest of the group consisted of a changing group of session musicians.\n\nThey achieved some popularity during the 1980s. Their hit &quot;Funkytown&quot; spent four weeks at Number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in the United States and was awarded a platinum record. It reached number two in the United Kingdom and was a hit throughout the world. Their further singles failed to match their initial success (their only other Hot 100 entry was &quot;Rock It&quot;, which peaked at #64), however they had more dance hits throughout the 1980s, including &quot;How Long&quot; in 1981, which reached #4 on the U.S. dance chart. The group ceased recording in 1983.\n\nThe song &quot;Funkytown&quot; has had popular recognition again recently due to a mash-up of it with Soulwax's dance track &quot;NY Excuse&quot; appearing on the Soulwax remix album Nite Versions. The track is titled &quot;NY Lipps&quot;.
