However they have to watch out for the evil &quot;NÃƒÂ¥sÃƒÂ¥&quot;, who          \n      during the series comes to live with a potato farmer nearby. The      \n      series is based on funny lines containing dialect                     \n      (the potato farmer) or a mix between Norwegian and English            \n      (the nisses). The lines are repeated in episode after episode,        \n      and if a good line occurs, one of the nisses will say                 \n      &quot;Hey, that&amp;#039;s a good vending (phrase).
