A studio waitress turns out to be pregnant. This gives them the idea for a movie about a cowboy and a baby. The waitress&amp;#039;s baby becomes the star. The cowboy and his agent run off with the waitress and her valuable asset. The writers retaliate by hiring an unemployed extra to impersonate the baby&amp;#039;s father. But the extra already knows the waitress.\n\nJames Cagney ...  Robert Law \nPat O&amp;#039;Brien ...  J. Carlyle &amp;#039;J.C.&amp;#039; Benson \nMarie Wilson ...
