Much like AC/DC, the Angels seem to work to a formula, so you'll never be surprised by the music, and if you like the formula you'll seldom be disappointed. There's nothing light and airy about this album, it's all dark rock, with the pick being &quot;Man There&quot;, and the disappointment probably &quot;We Gotta Get Outa This Place&quot;, which is a cover anyway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e68d3aa9373b9e90c036d6b082f31ac39bad748","amp;dn":"the+angels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e68d3aa9373b9e90c036d6b082f31ac39bad748","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,104,211,170,147,115,185,233,12,3,109,107,8,47,49,172,57,186,215,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
