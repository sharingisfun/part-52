It also supports several related utilities, such as VorbisGain and WavGain.\n\nIt isn't an overly fancy GUI, like the famous dBPowerAmp Music Converter, but it's very small, and isn't system invasive. It includes many command pre-sets, for those who aren't familiar with the command switches of the various codecs, and can remember the switches you use, so you never need to retype them.\n\nNote that no encoders/decoders are included. You may download your preferred versions of any encoders/decoders you wish---just use the settings to tell Multi-Frontend where those files are located on your system.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f873ed3300746a128a5899a2f375ec7889899491","amp;dn":"multi_frontend.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f873ed3300746a128a5899a2f375ec7889899491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,115,237,51,0,116,106,18,138,88,153,162,243,117,236,120,137,137,148,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
