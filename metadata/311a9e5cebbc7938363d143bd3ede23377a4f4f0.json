I dare to say it isnt :-(\nIt works good and well as long as you use it to mount, view and\nplay the mounted virtual Image. BUT, when doing a Clone or Copying\nthat mounted image it becomes clear that it still have &quot;Vista-issues\nneeded to be fixed&quot; For this special kind of use, use Daemon tools\ninstead (at least if you run Vista as your OS)\nSo if you need to do that use Daemon tools instead....\nDVDFab Platinum is a simple to use program what works very well\nin the most cases, BUT, when it comes to heavily protected discs\nits not as good as AnyDVD (Finded it out by own testing)\n\n\nHope you enjoy this little toolbox folks :o)\n\nWith regards/lucifer\n\n\n\nHoppas ni har anvÃƒÂ¤ndning av denna lilla verktygslÃƒÂ¥da :o)\n\nMed vÃƒÂ¤nliga hÃƒÂ¤lsningar/lucifer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311a9e5cebbc7938363d143bd3ede23377a4f4f0","amp;dn":"Slysoft+20071130+%2B+DVDFab+Platinum+4.0.1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311a9e5cebbc7938363d143bd3ede23377a4f4f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,26,158,92,235,188,121,56,54,61,20,59,211,237,226,51,119,164,244,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
