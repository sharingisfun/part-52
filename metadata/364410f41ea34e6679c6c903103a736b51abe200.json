Unknown to the kidnappers, the shy and reserved David actually has a hidden agenda of his own, and a mysterious way of tapping into the minds of others. Soon, Max will wish that he had never kidnapped David, much less even heard of him.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:364410f41ea34e6679c6c903103a736b51abe200","amp;dn":"Whisper.2007.DVDRiP.XViD-P2PXVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"364410f41ea34e6679c6c903103a736b51abe200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,68,16,244,30,163,78,102,121,198,201,3,16,58,115,107,81,171,226,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
