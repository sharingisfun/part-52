They said they couldn&amp;#039;t make an image file or ISO with the music for some reason. I found that to be ridiculous, went into Nero, started a new Mixed-Mode CD, added the files from the image file I downloaded, added my own CD-quality MP3s in the audio portion, and burned a CD to an image file. This NRG file (burnable using Nero) is of the complete Skirmish CD, including the CD audio files.\n\nJust burn a CD using this image file and you will be able to hear the music from it in the game as well. No need for seperate MP3s or burning a seperate disc. This image file includes the CD audio in it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a39d402c3dfedbf52ae4083b5a398cdbf937878d","amp;dn":"Total+Annihilation+image+file+that+includes+CD+audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a39d402c3dfedbf52ae4083b5a398cdbf937878d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,157,64,44,61,254,219,245,42,228,8,59,90,57,140,219,249,55,135,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
