And, though their voices had been frazzled a bit by constant touring, they revved them up for some joyous shouting, and indulged their fondness for American country in subtle, playful ways.\n\n\n     SIDE A\n01 - No Reply\t\t\t(2:21)\n02 - Im A Loser\t\t\t(2:34)\n03 - Babys In Black\t\t(2:10)\n04 - Rock And Roll Music\t\t(2:36)\n05 - Ill Follow The Sun\t\t(1:53)\n06 - Mr. Moonlight\t\t\t(2:44)\n07 - Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey\t(2:42)\n\n     SIDE B\n08 - Eight Days A Week\t\t(2:47)\n09 - Words Of Love\t\t\t(2:08)\n10 - Honey Dont\t\t\t(3:01)\n11 - Every Little Thing\t\t(2:07)\n12 - I Dont Want To Spoil The Party\t(2:36)\n13 - What Youre Doing\t\t(2:34)\n14 - Everybodys Trying To Be My...\t(2:25)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfaf61cf8aa2d9c84f7b84cec83ba0d8d66f09a1","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Beatles+For+Sale+LP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfaf61cf8aa2d9c84f7b84cec83ba0d8d66f09a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,175,97,207,138,162,217,200,79,123,132,206,200,59,160,216,214,111,9,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
