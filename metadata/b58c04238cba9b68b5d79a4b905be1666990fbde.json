Start the Launchpad and let it download the rest of the files for you. Should only be about 150MB instead of 5.15GB.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58c04238cba9b68b5d79a4b905be1666990fbde","amp;dn":"PotBS-BETA-GeNeSiS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58c04238cba9b68b5d79a4b905be1666990fbde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,140,4,35,140,186,155,104,181,215,154,75,144,91,225,102,105,144,251,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
