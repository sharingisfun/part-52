This Sid Davis Production contains such quotes as:\n\n&quot;What Jimmy didn&amp;#039;t know was that Ralph was sick; a sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious; a sickness of the mind. You see, Ralph was a homosexual: a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex.&quot;\n\nAnd, of course:\n\n&quot;One never knows when a homosexual is about. He may appear normal and it may be too late when you discover he is mentally ill.&quot;\n\nThis is a ten-minute short movie made in 1961. It has since lapsed into the public domain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa50a0e41d9f199f9366603cbb3bfcbd1cf279e","amp;dn":"Boys+Beware","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa50a0e41d9f199f9366603cbb3bfcbd1cf279e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,165,10,14,65,217,241,153,249,54,102,3,203,179,191,203,209,207,39,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
