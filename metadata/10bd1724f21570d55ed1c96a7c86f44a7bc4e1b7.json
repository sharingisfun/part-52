Each character has\n    unique moves.  Gain points and upgrade your sled.\n\n  * Master 12 Outlandish Winter Tracks that will assault your senses\n    from the Swiss Alps to The Lost City of Atlantis.\n\n  * Fight head-to-head with 2-4 friends in one of 5 open Battle Arenas.\n\n  * Upgrade Shop: Acquire points and upgrade your sled by increasing\n    the snowmobile's power, and the number, strength and accuracy of\n    power-ups.\n\n  * Six Different Modes: Race, Points, Battle Arena, Upgrade Shop,\n    Training and Arcade.\n\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &quot;MODE1/2048&quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.\n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X-\n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  /\n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    /\n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     /\n                              ___/              /        _ _\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10bd1724f21570d55ed1c96a7c86f44a7bc4e1b7","amp;dn":"Arctic+Thunder+XBOX+-+ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10bd1724f21570d55ed1c96a7c86f44a7bc4e1b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,189,23,36,242,21,112,213,94,209,201,106,124,134,244,74,123,196,225,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
