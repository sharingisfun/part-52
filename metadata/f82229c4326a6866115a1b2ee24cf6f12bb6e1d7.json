They started to rock in 2001. The place was Kungsbacka, a small |\n|town south of GÃƒÂ¶teborg. The two guitarists, Tomas and Daniel, had played    |\n|together before but they wanted to start a band that really had the         |\n|potential to become something special. And with Robin behind the drums they | \n|contacted the former hardcore screamer Rickard and asked him if he was      |\n|interested in doing some singing. Rickard who had bin playing heavy music   |\n|for a long time felt that this could be a fresh restart. After a few        |\n|rehearsals with Rickard behind the mic Stoneville was formed. Stoneville    |\n|had two different bassists before DG joined the band in March 2004.         |\n|After have bin playing over 50 gigs the band was contacted by a record      |\n|lable called Sunday music. They wanted to sign a contract. Not long after,  |\n|the band went into the studio and started the recordings for their          |\n|coming album. During that time the band felt that they wanted a namechange. |\n|HERO in action was now born!                                                |\n|                                                                            |\n| If u like the artists, support them!
