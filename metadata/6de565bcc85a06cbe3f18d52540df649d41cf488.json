Bond returns from his travels in the USSR with a computer chip. This chip is capable of blowing out all other digital chips and causing a nuclear explosion. The chip was created by Zorin Industries, and Bond heads off to investigate its owner, Max Zorin (Walken). Zorin may only seem like a innocent guilty man, but is really planning to set off an earthquake in San Andreas which will wipe out all of Silicon Valley. As well as Zorin, Bond must also tackle May Day (Jones) and equally menacing companion of Zorin, whilst dragging Stacy Sutton (Roberts) along for the ride.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de565bcc85a06cbe3f18d52540df649d41cf488","amp;dn":"James.Bond.007_A.View.To.A.Kill_1985.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de565bcc85a06cbe3f18d52540df649d41cf488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,229,101,188,200,90,6,203,227,241,141,82,84,13,246,73,212,28,244,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
