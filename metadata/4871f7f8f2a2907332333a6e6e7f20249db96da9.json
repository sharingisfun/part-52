Personally I don&amp;#039;t mind. If it&amp;#039;s the lucky stars, that means 1. Richard Ng, whose posture is enough to crack me up, and 2. Sammo action. Now that the men are all aging, there are more fashionable jokes cracked instead of them always trying to cup a feel. Of course that doesn&amp;#039;t mean the directors didn&amp;#039;t want the male viewers to be satisfied, as Sammo, Corey Yuen and Eric Tsang agreed on the kicking female wearing a short dress in all her scenes. But the four of them (sometimes with Sammo but not always; he&amp;#039;s the least funny of the crowd) always produce side-splitting comedy. For example, when Eric Tsang cleverly places the whole bottle of sleeping pills in the soup - including the bottle itself - or when Richard Ng walks by a woman and says whatever&amp;#039;s on his mind, it turns into a guilty pleasure. I enjoy the lucky stars, and their pathetic attempts at any kind of sex are amusing. I hadn&amp;#039;t seen the whole movie before I watched the end fight, but starting the disc from the beginning kept me glued to my seat, entertained by everything I saw. My favorite will always be Richard Ng, who will miss a game of poker just to study a hypnotic spell, which undoubtably always fails.\n\nStars: Sammo Hung, Elaine Lui, Richard Ng, Stanley Fung, Eric Tsang, Charlie Chin\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thestuntpeople.com/articles/ghostpunting.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thestuntpeople.com/articles/ghostpunting.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
