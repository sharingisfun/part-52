It catalogs your CDs, OGG, WMA, MPC, FLAC, APE, WAV and MP3 audio files. It looks up missing Album Art and track information via Freedb and the web, and includes an intelligent tag editor and an automated file and directory renamer to organize your music library. It includes a CD ripper, CD/DVD Burner, and audio converter for saving music, and manual or automated playlist editors for creating music mixes. Its player automatically adjusts volume levels so that you don&amp;#039;t have continually fiddle with the volume control and supports hundreds of Winamp plug-ins and visualizations; or if you prefer, it can use Winamp as the default player.It also includes portable audio device synchronization that allows you to synch tracks and play lists with devices such as the iPod and other portable audio devices.\n\nStandard FEATURES:\n- Organize music and edit tags in your audio library with a powerful, intuitive interface\n- Automatically lookup and tag Album Art and other metadata\n- Manage 50,000+ files in your music collection without bogging down\n- Play MP3s and other audio formats, and never again worry about varying volume\n- Record CDs into OGG, MP3, FLAC and WMA files\n- Convert MP3s, OGG, FLAC and WMA files into other formats with the Audio Converter\n- Create playlists and music mixes quickly and easily to suit any occasion\n- Synchronize with iPods / MP3 players effortlessly and convert tracks on-the-fly\nPlus much more...\n\nGold FEATURES:\n- Find music with advanced search functionality that digs through your collection to find tracks according to almost any criteria that you can think of.

If the F8 method does not work, repeat the procedure, but press the F8 key more quickly, or press it several times.\n- On some (older) computers, the F8 key method may not work. In these Windows versions you may also configure your computer to start in Safe mode through the System Configuration Utility (msconfig).\n- In some cases Norman Malware Cleaner may require that you restart the computer to completely remove an infection\n\nSupported operating systems are: Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP and 2003\n\nHomepage - http://www.norman.com/Virus/Virus_removal_tools/en\n\nSize: 13.9 MB\n\n\n\n\n\nPicturesToExe creates slide show in stand-alone EXE file. \n\nUsing a clean-looking, intuitive interface, you select pictures from any combination of folders on your system.

By time Windows registry gathers a lot of invalid entries that cause system complications and slow down your computer significantly. Included in Abexo Registry Cleaner is a registry defragmenter also called compressor which removes the empty spaces after a cleanup and thereby reduces registry size. Registry defragmentation increases the performance of your computer dramatically. Supported platforms: Windows Vista and Windows XP.\n\nAbexo Registry Cleaner Features:\n- Disk cleanup\n- Scan disk\n- Disk defrag\n- Registry backup\n- Registry cleanup\n- Registry defrag\n- Computer shutdown/restart\n\nRegistry is a database where Windows and programs store their data. When data changes i.e. you delete a file, the registry doesn&amp;#039;t remove the invalid data, thus in this case a reference to a non-existent file remains in the registry.\nAs the registry gets filled with invalid data, Windows and programs consume more system resources to search the database for any data. Therefore your computer gets slower and slower. Last but not least, passing invalid data to Windows programs can cause severe system complications resulting in system crash, hang and malfunction.\n\nAfter a registry cleanup the invalid entries leave empty spaces, which means the size of the registry remains unchanged. It goes without saying that loading a small registry is faster than a big one.\n\nThe Auto run feature is a one-click registry backup, registry cleanup and registry defrag.\n\nFurthermore if you own a copy of Abexo defragmenter you can configure them to work together. Just click a button and go to bed. All of the following tasks will be performed while you are asleep.\n\nChanges in Abexo Registry Cleaner 5.3:\n- Scanning of System Services added.\n\nHomepage - http://www.abexo.com/registry-cleaner.htm\n\nSize: 1.18 MB \n\n\n\n\n\nTo iPod Converter 4.78\n\nVideo EditorsConvert almost all kinds of video files to ipod !\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Let your Apple iPod much super and advanced!
