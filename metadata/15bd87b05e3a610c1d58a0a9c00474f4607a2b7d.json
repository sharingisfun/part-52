After 9/11 Scientology disrupted rescue efforts by barging across barricades meant to keep the public out of danger at Ground Zero.\n\nIn Beslan, authorities had to physically remove Scientology Volunteer Ministers that were harassing grief-stricken parents and teachers following a terrorist attack on a public school that left over 300 children dead.\n\nAfter the shootings at Virginia Tech, set up their yellow tent in the center of the campus and began trying to recruit the vulnerable survivors of this tragedy.\n\nThere is a great deal of Scientology Hype surrounding 9/11. Tom Cruise and Scientology swiftly moved to take advantage of the tragedy, and there was a great deal of media coverage of his presence at the opening of the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Program. Unfortunately, the detox program introduced is scientifically unproven and a potentially dangerous process. This same program is used by Narconon -- another Scientology front-group targeting drug addicts and their families.\n\n\nEMBEDDED VIDEO #2: YANKED OFF SERVER BY SCIENTOLOGY\n\nPart 3: Tom Cruise: Scientology's Biggest Tool\n\nDescription: &quot;For once,&quot; says Cruise, &quot;we have the whole track. We have the tools we can apply to ourselves and apply to others. You know the tech and you apply it correctly and it's KSW.&quot; This is an excellent example of Scientology's internal jargon - words that make sense only to another Scientologist. &quot;Whole Track&quot; refers to your entire history; not only in this lifetime, but all your past lives. However, Scientologists are not allowed to discuss this in public. It would be very awkward if two Adolph Hitlers were to meet each other in this lifetime.\n\n\nEMBEDDED VIDEO #3: YANKED OFF A SERVER BY SCIENTOLOGY\n\nPart 4: Tom Cruise on Psychiatry: &quot;Go to guns!&quot;\n\nDescription: Cruise reserves his most vituperative prose for the mental health industry, and psychiatry in particular. In this clip, his speech turns violent, with references like, &quot;crush these guys,&quot; and, &quot;go to guns.&quot; &quot;Go to guns&quot; is a fighter pilot term. Tom Cruise is not a fighter pilot, but he did play one in a movie.\n\nEMBEDDED VIDEO #4: YANKED OFF A SERVER BY SCIENTOLOGY\n\nPart 5: Tom Cruise: &quot;I am a Scientologist&quot;\n\nDescription: Okayyy....\n\nEMBEDDED VIDEO #5: YANKED OFF A SERVER BY SCIENTOLOGY\n\nPart 6: Tom Cruise: In the Corridors of Power\n\nDescription: A star-studded Worldwide Mission: Impossible\n\nEMBEDDED VIDEO #6: YANKED OFF A SERVER BY SCIENTOLOGY\n\nPart 7: Tom Cruise's Mind on Tom Cruise: Scientologist\n\nIn this, the most mind-bendingly bizarre clip in the collection, you will notice the actor's most maniacal grin, reserved for his anecdote about being asked, &quot;Have you ever met an SP?&quot; He bares his over-sized teeth and expresses a yearning for the day when SPs are extinct. &quot;SP&quot; stands for Suppressive Person, and, if you are reading this, Tom Cruise wants you dead.\n\nEMBEDDED VIDEO #7: YANKED OFF A SERVER BY SCIENTOLOGY\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15bd87b05e3a610c1d58a0a9c00474f4607a2b7d","amp;dn":"Tom+Cruise+Scientology+Home+Videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15bd87b05e3a610c1d58a0a9c00474f4607a2b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,189,135,176,94,58,97,12,29,88,160,169,192,4,116,244,96,122,43,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
