It stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, a temperamental and paranoid but tenacious boxer who alienates himself from his friends and family. Also featured in the film are Joe Pesci as Joey, La Motta&amp;#039;s brother and manager, and Cathy Moriarty as his abused wife. The film features supporting roles from Nicholas Colasanto (who was eventually to play the character &quot;Coach&quot; on the TV sitcom Cheers), Theresa Saldana, and Frank Vincent, who has starred in many films directed by Martin Scorsese. After receiving mixed initial reviews, it went on to garner a high critical reputation and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made.&quot; -Wikipedia\n\nThis is a DVD rip with optional Hebrew subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b143019a394edbd0466fcb0250f474f6e88f1709","amp;dn":"Raging+Bull+clowne+%5BDVD-R+with+Hebrew+Subtitles%5D.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b143019a394edbd0466fcb0250f474f6e88f1709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,67,1,154,57,78,219,208,70,111,203,2,80,244,116,246,232,143,23,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
