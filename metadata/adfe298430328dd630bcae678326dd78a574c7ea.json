Their sloppiness puts your computer in danger of a crash. RegVac regularly cleans out their bugs. \n\nGet your Registry Sparkling Clean \nBesides the normal dirt that RegVac and other registry cleaners clean, there are thousands of dirt piles hiding which other registry cleaners don&amp;#039;t even attempt to get.

This tool removes hundreds of the most common stashes and allows you to add the location of stashes that you discover. Other registry cleaners do not clean the stashes. \n\nCleaner #3 - Lists Cleaner \nMany lists in the registry require special handling. This cleaner uses extra processes to discover concealed problems in the following lists: Known Drivers, Static VxD, Open GL Drivers, Shared Drivers, Start Menu, Startup, Help, Fonts, AppPaths, Extensions, HTML Help, Installed Files, Add/Remove Cache, Installer, and MUICache.. \n\nCleaner #4 - Software Cleaner \nThe largest part of the registry is the Software section. This cleaner searches through the Software section and finds keys that may be left over from deleted and uninstalled programs. \n\nCleaner #5 - Bad Link Cleaner \nThis cleaner looks from one end of the registry to the other for references to files that do not exist on your computer. Remove all of the found entries or use the Show Key button to examine each one. \n\nCleaner #6 - Junk Cleaner \nSpyware and Adware love to put entries in your registry.

This editor opens that area up and allows you to remove the ones you want\n\nSEVEN TOOLS\n\n\nTool #1 - System Configuration Utility \nMSConfig is a neat little Windows utility that gives you behind-the-scenes access to your system&amp;#039;s configuration. This tool opens msconfig for you with the click of a button and removes disabled entries in it from the registry. \n\nTool #2 - Software Cleanup \nEven when you properly uninstall software, fragments may be left behind.
