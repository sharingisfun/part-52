It was an old schoolhouse which had been converted into a recording studio by Bob Leth and Brian Ferryman. (Brian Ferryman would later go on to be the manager of Michel Wright, the Canadian country star.) The album was financed by our manager Bill Seip, Brent\\&amp;#039;s parents, my parents, and my grandmother.\n\nAnother interesting note about this album is that Lydia Taylor, who would later win a Canadian Juno award for \\&quot;Female Vocalist of the Year\\&quot; sang background vocals on \\&quot;You\\&amp;#039;re A Woman Now\\&quot;. This song would become our first U.S. \\&quot;hit\\&quot;, although only in Texas, and would lead to our first tour of that state.\n\nIn 1999 the Breaking Loose album was released for the first time in it\\&amp;#039;s original form on CD. It is available through the Merchandise section here at Planet Helix.\n\nIt is interesting to note that when we recorded this album it was unheard of to release an \\&quot;Indie\\&quot; album. We sold nearly 15,000 copies of this album from the stage between sets.
