Next, &quot;Have Sex With \nA Tree&quot; is a stupendously melodic magical carpet ride, like Squarepusher's \n'Port Rhombus' on an even more polyhedral day.\n\nNext, &quot;My God Is Better Than Yours&quot; sets a sweet Grandma-plucked acoustic \nguitar loop and drapes strings, minimal drums, and intentionally lo-fi vocals \nover the top to heartfelt effect. And finally, yes, &quot;Amazing Larry Does Not \nBite Off Of Other Songs&quot; does include an expressionless robotic voice rapping \nabout 'biting off lines' from 'Ruff Ryder's Anthem'. What of it?\n\nSo what's the point? Maybe that this music is touching enough to make you \nfeel good when you're in a bad place, and strong when you're in a weak place \n- and it's just the tip of the strangely skewed iceberg when it comes to \nGrandma's material, which richly deserves a wider audience still. We hope he \ngets it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&amp;lt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c5f2d3528d2c43443c210122e4775c8b749a06","amp;dn":"Grandma+AKA+Khonnor+-+Bopping+Around+In+A+Skin+Car+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c5f2d3528d2c43443c210122e4775c8b749a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,197,242,211,82,141,44,67,68,60,33,1,34,228,119,92,139,116,154,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
