The three scientists who found the woman - \nMichaels, Osbourne and Dr. Woods - believe she is thousands of years old. Tissue \ntests show that, unlike normal human cells, which suffer irreparable damage when \nfrozen, the woman&amp;#039;s cells are perfectly intact. Aiyana, as Michaels has named \nher, is defrosted and slowly comes to life. EEG&amp;#039;s indicate that Aiyana may be an \nexample of advanced human evolution, with cells that have evolved to withstand \nsub-zero temperatures. Carter theorizes that her races may have evolved long \nmodern day humans. Michael&amp;#039;s contracts an incurable virus from Aiyana, who seems \nimmune to its effects. Osbourne falls ill. Then Dr. Woods gets lost in an \nAntarctic blizzard, forcing Teal&amp;#039;c and O&amp;#039;Neill set out on a rescue mission. \nTeal&amp;#039;c and O&amp;#039;Neill find the doctor nearly frozen and haul him back to the base \ndome for treatment.

With her immune system weakened by \nthe stress of all that healing, Aiyana succumbs to the virus as well. O&amp;#039;Neill \nbegins to show symptoms, but Aiyana dies before she can help him. Back at SGC, \na Tok&amp;#039;ra named Thoran informs the team that O&amp;#039;Neill will die unless he accepts \na symbiote. O&amp;#039;Neill is reluctant, but Carter assures him that the symbiote will \nonly stay until he is cured and the Tok&amp;#039;ra can find a new host. When Carter \nmentions that the symbiote has important information acquired during a recent \nmission, before the untimely death of its host, O&amp;#039;Neill agrees to have the \nprocedure.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447d1a2855ab85b1065ade943cc5c7d3dba0d6b3","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG-1+Season+6+Disc+1.StarFans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447d1a2855ab85b1065ade943cc5c7d3dba0d6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,125,26,40,85,171,133,177,6,90,222,148,60,197,199,211,219,160,214,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
