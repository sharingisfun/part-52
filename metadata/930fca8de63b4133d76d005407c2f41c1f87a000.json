In September 1979, the show was revamped, and given a new title, Archie Bunker&amp;#039;s Place. This version of the sitcom lasted another four years, ending its run in 1983.\n\nProduced by Norman Lear and based on the British television series Til Death Us Do Part, the show broke ground in its depiction of issues previously deemed unsuitable for U.S. network television comedy, such as racism, homosexuality, women&amp;#039;s liberation, rape, miscarriage, breast cancer and impotence.\n\nThe show ranked #1 in the yearly Nielsen ratings from 1972 to 1976. As of 2007, The Cosby Show has been the only other show to top the ratings for at least five consecutive seasons. In 2002, All in the Family was ranked #4 on TV Guide&amp;#039;s list of the 50 greatest TV shows of all time. TV Guide also named the show&amp;#039;s protagonist, Archie Bunker, TV&amp;#039;s greatest character of all time.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:930fca8de63b4133d76d005407c2f41c1f87a000","amp;dn":"All+in+the+Family+-+S1+D1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"930fca8de63b4133d76d005407c2f41c1f87a000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,15,202,141,230,59,65,51,215,109,0,84,7,194,244,28,31,135,160,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
