This is the first in a ten-part adaptation of Flora Thompson&amp;#039;s magical memoir of her Oxfordshire childhood.\n\nSet in the small hamlet of Lark Rise and the wealthier neighbouring market town, Candleford, the series chronicles the daily lives of farm-workers, craftsmen and gentry at the end of the 19th Century.\n\nThis world is seen through the eyes of a teenage girl, Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan - Sugar Rush, Torchwood) as she leaves Lark Rise to start a new life under the wing of the independent and effervescent Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha - Hornblower, Pride And Prejudice) who is post-mistress at the local post office in Candleford.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/larkrise/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/larkrise/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81aff6704afd8dcaf4a0175c46b94cafa936006b","amp;dn":"Lark+Rise+to+Candleford+1x03+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81aff6704afd8dcaf4a0175c46b94cafa936006b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,175,246,112,74,253,141,202,244,160,23,92,70,185,76,175,169,54,0,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
