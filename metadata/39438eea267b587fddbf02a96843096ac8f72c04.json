Since bands such as Wolfchant also are enjoying fair amounts of success, it`s perfectly possible that some of my complaints in this review are to blame on my peculiar tastes. As such, I simply recommend that fans of pagan/folk metal give this album a listen; I don`t think you`ll be disappointed.\n\nSongs to check out: Die Suche nach dem Licht, Rauschende NÃƒÂ¤chte, Weinende Ruinen, Weltenpilger\n\n-\n\nRipped with EAC, then converted to FLAC / Lame 3.97 at max quality from original CD of the 100 limited edition tin boxes.\n\nIncluding scanned covers and official lyrics\n\n-\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39438eea267b587fddbf02a96843096ac8f72c04","amp;dn":"Finsterforst+-+%5B2007%5D+-+Weltenkraft+%28EAC-FLAC-MP3%40320+%2B+covers+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39438eea267b587fddbf02a96843096ac8f72c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,67,142,234,38,123,88,127,221,191,2,169,104,67,9,106,200,247,44,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
