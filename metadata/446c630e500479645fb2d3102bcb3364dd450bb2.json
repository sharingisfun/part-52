This video is nearly as solid as his third, and a worthy follow up. With its release, Doors\\&amp;#039;s confirmed his place as one of the most influential pk video makers of all time. This is one of the first highly successful vengeance videos, and was an important predecessor to many other vengeance works. For the first time in this video a pker showed the immense power of vengeance, which was still relatively unknown as a tactic upon the release of this video.\n\n--\n\nSeeded by Doodlepieguy.
