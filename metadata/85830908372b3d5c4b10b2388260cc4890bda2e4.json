Many discs that she cut from her Pre-Verve years were throwaway novelty singles, and her Verve years spent helping others acknowledge the Great American Songbook as a leading musical art form, but this album, recorded at the end of her tenure with Verve, represents the desire that Ella felt to still remain &amp;#039;hip&amp;#039;, in an ever changing musical landscape, ableit one in which she had always had a place.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nElla Fitzgerald - Vocals\nTommy Flanagan - Piano\nFrank DeLaRosa - Bass\nEd Thigpen - Drums\nFrank DeVol - Arranger, Conductor.\nErnie Heckscher - Arranger, Conductor.\n\nProduced by Norman Granz.
