Make a folder, call it what ever you want, the xbe will rename it. Then use what ever means you have to launch the engine within preferred dash. Here is an example. You could put it in the apps folder for evox. Then go into evox and scroll down to program manager and it will be listed as Xored Mini Launcher.\nOnce engine is running:\nOur engine will auto detect your games. Meaning the engine will realize where the game you are trying to load is. It will know if it is DVD or HDD. So just scroll to the trainer you want to load and press start. Then choose options you want and press start. Then enjoy the game.\n\nWe added a rapid scroll key. It is the Left Trigger, just like the one we all have used in the EVOX dash. So getting through your trainer list will be quick and painless.\nPlease look for updated info on our engine in the days to come. Also watch for our updates. It will take time for the community to realize the full potential of our engine. So for now have fun with it. For all trainer authors out there, the size limit of evox is no more. Our engine will handle a much bigger ETM XBE. So go ahead and Keep those options coming. Maybe someone will train a game to play itself. Oh wait, I think that is called a demo. Never mind.\n\nTeam Xored wishes to thank all who have supported us. This release has been a long time coming and it required a lot of patients from everyone. Thank you so much. We look forward to providing our upcoming projects.\n\n. . ________________________________Credits___________ _____________________\n\n\n\nETM Emulation Engine Programmers:\nAcidflash, Starlight, and Dootdoo\n\nXored Members:\n[Death].....Co-Founder/Trainer Author\nAcidflash...Co-Founder/Lead Design&amp;System engineer/Guru\nStarlight...Co-Founder/Programmer/Master Hacker/Guru\nMikerowesoft...Leader/Public Relations/Marketing/Grfx Design\nRobozeo....Lead Trainer Development/Trainer Authoring Manager\n\nSpecial Thanks To:\nmodchipstore.com....................Official Team Xored Sponsor\nZeus.......................Hosting/Site Owner/Best Friend of Xored\nxbdev.net..................................Tutoria ls\nddh...................................XDK assist\n[team assembly].........................XKUtils\nwampa............................................G FX\nJay FNG.....................Game Saves Pimp\nDDKRAM............................Beta Tester\nFalcon 3...............................Beta Tester\nDoGoD................................Beta Tester\nKiK......................................Beta Tester\nMaster Splinter.....................Beta Tester\nJason Voorhees.....................Beta Tester\nRooR....................................Beta Tester\nDivineo.com.............................Tech/Equipment Support\nFor Support Please Visit\nhttp://forums.maxconsole.net\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e555cbde88a2938ae8eced73801c9ed9736621b","amp;dn":"Xored+ETM++Engine+Launcher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e555cbde88a2938ae8eced73801c9ed9736621b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,85,92,189,232,138,41,56,174,142,206,215,56,1,201,237,151,54,98,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
