Business schools don&amp;#039;t have a monopoly on worldly wisdom - if you care more about increasing your effectiveness at work than a diploma and a few lines on your resume, the &quot;Personal MBA&quot; is for you.\n\nAbout the author:\nJosh just graduated from the University of Cincinnati College of Business with concentrations in Business Information Systems, Real Estate, and Philosophy. He has worked at Procter &amp; Gamble for three years as a part of UC&amp;#039;s cooperative education program, and will be starting full-time at P&amp;G this fall. He has no intention of getting an MBA any time soon, but he does have a lot of good books to read. You can find him discussing the Personal MBA at http://www.personalmba.com or on his blog at http://www.joshkaufman.net.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _ \\ / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n\\_)_____)\\___ \\_____|\\_) \\__)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| \\__|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6bce41019df3af94074c54f9b6127a2ef20d665","amp;dn":"%28PDF+Manifesto%29+The+Personal+MBA+Mastering+Business+Without+Spen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6bce41019df3af94074c54f9b6127a2ef20d665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,188,228,16,25,223,58,249,64,116,197,79,155,97,39,162,239,32,214,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
