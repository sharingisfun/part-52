This time it focuses on British psychedelic music, and no surprise - the music is all very very good, with a kind of &quot;english&quot; feel to it. Reminds me of The Iveys, Small Faces, Donovan, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd, early Bowie or The Who. This is a good compilation of music indeed. The next volume in the series will arrive at a bay near you shortly ^_^\n\n\nHQ VBR rip\n\n\n\tTracklist:\n\n\n\t1.\t \tRed Dirt - &quot;Memories&quot; (2:06)\t\n\t2.\t \tGary Walker &amp; the Rain - &quot;Magazine Woman&quot; (4:59)\t\n\t3.\t \tAndwella's Dream - &quot;Felix&quot; (4:18)\t\n \t4.\t \tDark - &quot;Maypole&quot; (5:03)\t\n \t5.\t \tDogfeet - &quot;Now I Know&quot; (3:09)\t\n\t6.\t \tTony, Caro &amp; John - &quot;There Are No Greater Heroes&quot; (3:45)\t\n \t7.\t \tPussy - &quot;Comets&quot; (4:14)\t\n \t8.\t \tCandida Pax - &quot;Reach Out&quot; (3:32)\t\n\t9.\t \tMark Fry - &quot;Mandolin Man&quot; (3:54)\t\n \t10.\t \tMotherlight - &quot;On a Meadow-Lea&quot; (3:34)\t\n \t11.\t \tLightyears Away (Astral Navigations) - &quot;Yesterday&quot; (2:40)\t\n \t12.\t \tBodkin - &quot;Three Days After Death Pt. 1&quot; (4:34)\t\n\t13.\t \tForever Amber - &quot;The Dreamer Flies Back&quot; (3:24)\t\n\t14.\t \tOliver - &quot;Telephone&quot; (3:30)\t\n\t15.\t \tParameter - &quot;Harvington Hall&quot; (2:43)\n\n\n\tEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2808e4bb1f8475951a79dd61aff40f4ccb7d6192","amp;dn":"VA++-+Love%2C+Peace+%26+Poetry+%28British+Psychedelic+Music+60s+%2670s%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2808e4bb1f8475951a79dd61aff40f4ccb7d6192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,8,228,187,31,132,117,149,26,121,221,97,175,244,15,76,203,125,97,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
