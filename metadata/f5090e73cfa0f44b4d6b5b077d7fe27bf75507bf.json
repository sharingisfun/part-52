This works for Bergen 1.01, Amsterdam 1.04 (with AES support!)\n\nInstall instructions inside also... (the instructions worked for me, after experimentation... can&amp;#039;t make any promises!!!)\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI got this to work both with Amsterdam 1.04, Bergen 1.01 and the rest of Cloud9 sceneries (e.g LAX)\n\nWhat I did was simple! (this worked for me - dunno if it works for you - but here goes...)\n\n1. Install AMS 1.03 and Bergen 1.00 as described, and uploaded already... (with use of cracked bglman.dll and cracked esellerate dll&amp;#039;s)\n\n2. Once fully activated backup reg key for both airports!\n\n3. Uninstall Amsterdam &amp; Bergen (both updates and &quot;main&quot; scenery) DON&amp;#039;T restart or remove anything else... dont worry about bglman.dll as it gets overwritten in the next step!\n\n4. Install Amsterdam 1.04 Full and Bergen 1.01 Full (download from www.fscloud9.com) DON&amp;#039;T start FS9 yet!\n\n5. Run Cloud9_Amsterdam.reg and Cloud9_Bergen FS9.reg (default dir FS9 root) The backup reg-keys from step 2!!!\n\n6. Copy esellerateengine.dll and esell3658.dll to windows dir (overwrite if required!)\n\n7. Start FS9 and check if everything looks fine and working...\n\n\nThe above worked for me... In the procedure the original bglman.dll is kept! No cracked bglman.dll is needed here... at least not in my case...\n\n\n\n\nBE ADVISED!! - THIS PROCEDURE DOES NOT WORK FOR ZURICH AND FSDT&amp;#039;S SCENERIES (EXCEPT BERGEN)... THEY&amp;#039;RE USING A DIFFERENT PAYMENT-SYSTEM... \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the procedure described above, you end up using the original bglman.dll! This means, that I would advise you to install all Cloud9 sceneries with the crack, and then patch AMS &amp; BGO in the end... \n\nThe good news is, that you can use FSDT Zurich after installing, because you are using a genuine bglman.dll/dat file in modules folder... (can&amp;#039;t be cracked yet, but it&amp;#039;s good if you purchased it...) :-)\n\n\n\nAll credits goes to the genius&amp;#039; who made this crack!!! :-)\n\nLet me know of results!
