While walking home one night she is dragged off the street and bitten by a strange woman. Soon Kathleen goes from being a normal student to being a vampire. Kathleen&amp;#039;s need for blood is similar to a drug addict&amp;#039;s need for drugs, and we watch as she goes from one fix to the next.\nIt&amp;#039;s not about vampires, it is about resistance, or lack of it. About what may be right around the corner, about discipline, or about lack of discipline. About being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It can happen to anybody, and it happens to everybody. It&amp;#039;s a pyramid scheme.\n\nBeautiful black and white composition by Abel Ferrara tied tightly in a wonderfully creative Joe Delia score. Casting the usual Ferrara/indie suspects: Paul Calderone, Edie Falco, Kathryn Erbe, Lili Taylor, Annabella Sciorra. The theme of the movie presents 4 new questions for every one it answers. Do we have a choice? Can we resist? And just when we think we have it all figured out, Christopher Walken has to show up and throw an entirely new lilt on things.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e68e2427b2e5210883b54090dfe23f8e43795c","amp;dn":"The+Addiction+-+PAL+-+DVD5+-+Audio+%3A+En%2C+Ru+-+Subs+%3A+French","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e68e2427b2e5210883b54090dfe23f8e43795c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,230,142,36,39,178,229,33,8,131,181,64,144,223,226,63,142,67,121,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
