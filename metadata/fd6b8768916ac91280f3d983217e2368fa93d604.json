The big pluses are that these tracks are the remastered versions (in 24 bit), the sequencing is unique and provocative, and the music itself, as you already know if you are reading this, is killer. This is arguably a better issue than the American Chronicle series because of the new dimension added by not placing tracks chronologically.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd6b8768916ac91280f3d983217e2368fa93d604","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+-+Platinum+%5BOgg+Vorbis+-q6%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd6b8768916ac91280f3d983217e2368fa93d604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,107,135,104,145,106,201,18,128,243,217,131,33,126,35,104,250,147,214,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
