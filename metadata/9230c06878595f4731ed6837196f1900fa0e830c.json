Nice are the ones by White Rabbits and Eisley. Caribou is great, but &quot;The Milk Of Human Kindness&quot; was better. Rilo Kiley is not what you expected. I found it an album full of lyrics with sexual undercurrents: masochism, sex with minors, masturbation, whoring, blowjobs and one-night stands. It&amp;#039;s all there and not just my wishful thinking, thank you. All this to shameless &amp;#039;70&amp;#039;s popmusic. Hmmm. Twisted Abba and Fleetwood Mac by Rilo Kiley. \nBut listen to the song by Marike Jager. Great keyboards, great song.\n\n1. Mavis Staples - Down In Mississippi\n2. John Vanderslice - Time To Go\n3.
