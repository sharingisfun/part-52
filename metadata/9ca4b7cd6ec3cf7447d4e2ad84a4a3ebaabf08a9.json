However, German\n  commanders were beginning to reorganize a defense line as the Allied advance\n  stalled due to the lack of supplies. Montgomery argued that a single attack\n  should be on his line of advance through Holland and on to Germany. His plan,\n  code named &quot;Market-Garden&quot; called for an Allied Airborne Army consisting\n  of three Airborne Divisions to seize a series of five bridges over a one\n  hundred kilometer stretch through Holland. The final bridge, to be taken by\n  the British and Polish paratroopers at Arnhem, would get the Allies across\n  the Rhine and into Germany. Can you succeed where Montgomery failed?\n\nIntro Movie ripped\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca4b7cd6ec3cf7447d4e2ad84a4a3ebaabf08a9","amp;dn":"Panzer+Campaigns%3A+Market+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca4b7cd6ec3cf7447d4e2ad84a4a3ebaabf08a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,164,183,205,110,195,207,116,71,212,226,173,132,164,163,235,170,191,8,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
