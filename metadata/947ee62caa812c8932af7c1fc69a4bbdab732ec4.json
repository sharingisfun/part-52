Werewolf - A Time-Capsule Release\n\n\n1x01 - &quot;Pilot. Werewolf&quot;   \nFirst aired: 7/11/1987\nProduction Code: 6801\n\nA Time-Capsule Mini-DVD Release\nNovember 15, 2007\n\nPreviously, I had intended to make this series available as KVCD&amp;#039;s,\nhowever, not all DVD players can play VCD and not all that play VCD\ncan play KVCD, so, instead, the releases will now be DVD. Most of the\n.ISO&amp;#039;s are less than 1.46Gb, and can therefore be burned to those mini\ndvd-r&amp;#039;s such as Ritek Ridata 4X 8CM/1.46GB Mini DVD-R Media, or\nVerbatim (95238) White Inkjet Hub Printable 4X 1.4GB/8cm Mini DVD-R\nMedia or similar (these are typically used in DVD CamCorders). They can\nalso be burned to any standard DVD recordable disc (4.7Gb), but it\nseems a waste of the disc capacity (even so, that&amp;#039;s what I used). Any\nCD/DVD burning application should be able to burn these ISO images to\ndisc (Nero, Roxio, PlexTools, etc.). You could also just load the ISO\nimages into Nero Image Drive (comes with Nero and is awesome) and watch\nthem on your computer or copy the files off to reburn in an application\nof your choice. The Free 7-Zip (7-zip.org) or WinImage can be used to\nextract the files from the ISO images if you wish. The simplest way to\nenjoy them is to just burn the .ISO files to a blank DVD and watch them\non your television set. They are NTSC, but these days, most DVD players\nhandle NTSC and PAL with ease, so it shouldn&amp;#039;t be an issue.\n\n\nENJOY!\n\n\nEric Cord comes home to his apartment to find his roommate and best\nfriend, Ted, loading a gun with silver bullets. Ted confesses to Eric\nthat he is a werewolf, and that he is responsible for a series of\nbrutal killings in the area. Ted wants to end his own life, but he\ndoesn&amp;#039;t believe that he is strong enough to do it, so he asks Eric to\nhelp him. Eric doesn&amp;#039;t believe until the pentagram appears on Ted&amp;#039;s\npalm and starts to bleed. Ted transforms into a huge werewolf and goes\nafter Eric. Despite his love for his friend, Eric has no choice but to\nshoot him. Eric later discovers that he has been bitten and infected\nwith the curse. Using the information that Ted gave to him, he skips\nbail to search for Janos Skorzeny, the progenitor of the werewolf\nbloodline. If he can find and kill Skorzeny, then the curse will be\nlifted. Meanwhile, the bail bondsman has hired a bounty hunter named\nRogan to find Eric, and he&amp;#039;s closing in...\n\nWriter:\nAllan Cole, Frank Lupo\nDirector:\nDavid Hemmings\nGuest star:\nRobert Sutton (Motel Guest),\nGeraldine O&amp;#039;Brien (Mrs. Manickindam),\nHarold Ayer (Mr. Manickindam),\nGail O&amp;#039;Grady (Victim 1 in VW),\nJohn Quade (Storage Shed Owner),\nLinden Ashby (Victim 2 in VW),\nMichelle Johnson (Kelly Nichols),\nEthan Phillips (Eddie Armonni),\nRobert Krantz (Rudy),\nRaphael Sbarge (Ted Nichols)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:947ee62caa812c8932af7c1fc69a4bbdab732ec4","amp;dn":"DVD+Werewolf+%281987%29+%28TV%29+%28FOX%29+1x01+-+Pilot.+Werewolf+-+A+Time-C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"947ee62caa812c8932af7c1fc69a4bbdab732ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,126,230,44,170,129,44,137,50,175,124,31,198,154,75,189,171,115,46,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
