While the original featured only a handful of tracks (but found them transformed and tweaked ad infinitum), Alive 2007 is packed with productions, most of them short and many of them getting a big crowd response (all recorded at one show in Paris in June of 2007). As on their first two classic full-lengths, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo display excellent crowd control, pacing the record well, spacing the hits, and building the mood like the good crowd-pleasers they are. (The visuals included in the regular and deluxe editions reveal quite the stage show as well.) It has the feel of a greatest-hits-live concert, but energized by Daft Punk&amp;#039;s talents at weaving songs in and out of each other. Even songs from the comparatively desultory Human After All sound rejuvenated in context, with &quot;Robot Rock&quot; getting the show off to a rousing start. It may not be better or stronger than the original Alive 1997, but it&amp;#039;s definitely harder and faster.\n\nEAC 0.99pb3 secure &gt; FLAC 1.2.1 - 8 &gt; LAME 3.97 V0 w/ m3u &amp; log\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62b4423cd6189e3bc91ab2d65d828dc9d6d43a70","amp;dn":"Daft.Punk-Alive.2007%5BJapan.Special.Edition%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62b4423cd6189e3bc91ab2d65d828dc9d6d43a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,180,66,60,214,24,158,59,201,26,178,214,93,130,141,201,214,212,58,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
