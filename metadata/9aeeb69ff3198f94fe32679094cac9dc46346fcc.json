The music on Blue Break Beats dates from the late &amp;#039;60s and early &amp;#039;70s, when a large portion of Blue Note&amp;#039;s soul-jazz artists began experimenting with funk and rock, creating dense electric fusions that concentrated on rhythm, not improvisation. None of this music has ever received much critical praise from jazz purists, but in the late &amp;#039;80s and early &amp;#039;90s, scores of hip-hop and dance DJs discovered these old records and began sampling the original tracks to use in new rap and dance songs. By the early &amp;#039;90s, this jazz-rap-funk fusion had become hip and profitable, which led Blue Note to assemble the Blue Break Beats compilations. All of the tracks on the two discs are from late &amp;#039;60s and early &amp;#039;70s albums, featuring multi-layered percussion, organs, and guitars. Every song on the two discs -- which are sold separately -- is hot, with a deep funky groove, and there are no dull spots on the albums. Though it&amp;#039;s designed to appeal to fans of contemporary funk and rap, fans of rock-influenced soul-jazz will find Blue Break Beats a necessary purchase.\n\n                                                                       All Music Guide\n\n\n\n1   Richard &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes  - Grooving With Mr. G (4:14)\nBass [Electric] - Jerry Jemmot\nCongas - Ray Armando\nDrums - Darryl Washington\nElectric Piano - Weldon Irvine\nGuitar - Gerald Hubbard\nOrgan - Richard Groove Holmes\nWritten-By - Groove Holmes\n\n2 Grant Green - Sookie, Sookie (11:05)\nCongas - Joseph Armstrong\nDrums - Idris Muhammed\nGuitar - Grant Green\nOrgan - Ronnie Foster\nSaxophone [Tenor] - Claude Bartee\nVibraphone - William Bivens\nWritten-By - Covay , Cropper\n\n3 Lou Donaldson - Who&amp;#039;s Making Love (6:45)\nDrums - Leo Morris\nGuitar - Melvin Sparks\nOrgan - Charles Earland\nSaxophone [Alto] - Lou Donaldson\nTrumpet - Ed Williams\nWritten-By - B.
