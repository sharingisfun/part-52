This is a DVD release of an indie (low budget) retelling of the classic book by HG Wells. The acting is decent; something different. Story is great ofcourse. Graphics.. well.. I could have made better graphics with toothpics, glue, and a broken lampshade. Hell the Jeff Wayne PC game had better CG animation.\n\nEither way, worth watching at least once. I'll probably watch it several times. Also worth checking out the awesome flash driven website!\nhttp://www.pendragonpictures.com/WOTWKEY.html\n\nEnjoy\n\nIf you do not aspire to find yourself upon the path of LoL!!~, ever will you wander the insipid paths of fgtry, rnd and irr.\n  - Mark Twain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3e005b36df009e02f93ddda5331bf2972a52a70","amp;dn":"HG+Wells+-+War+of+the+Worlds+%28Pendragon+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3e005b36df009e02f93ddda5331bf2972a52a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,224,5,179,109,240,9,224,47,147,221,218,83,49,191,41,114,165,42,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
