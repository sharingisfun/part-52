Besides this EP they also did some loud gigs at the local university. Since they just &quot;wanted to play some music&quot;, they took the easy way and played covers, but not wanting to be like everybody else, they tried to find obscure and unknown songs to mold in theyre own raw punky garage-rock style.\n\nThe covers range from fairly well-known songs to an obscure early David Bowie-tune. Strangely, contrary to musical tradition, the first song is actually the worst, but dont judge the book by it's cover. The other songs are good, especially their raw interpretation of the James Bond-soundtrack &quot;Tomorrow never dies&quot;, and the often covered &quot;Don't wanna know if you are lonely&quot;.\n\n\nTracklisting\n1. Sleep (Lagwagon cover)\n2. Tomorrow never dies (Sheryl Crow cover)\n3. Shes got medals (David Bowie cover)\n4. Don't wanna know if you are lonely (Husker Du cover)\n5. I saw her standing there (Beatles cover)\n\n\n(Note that there also was/is an american band called &quot;The Clues&quot;; this is not them.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42630bcbc0d9223b0976b3de5c7c0904e7b9011c","amp;dn":"The+Clues+-+EP+2002+%28Garage+punk%2Frock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42630bcbc0d9223b0976b3de5c7c0904e7b9011c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,99,11,203,192,217,34,59,9,118,179,222,92,124,9,4,231,185,1,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
