These songs exist in other places in other forms, especially Nice Time. But theses are longer and different versions than you&amp;#039;ve probably heard before. I believe these versions are out of print and are very difficult to find today. Album sleeve photos are included in the torrent.\n\nEnjoy and please share freely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:771f937800f60e2e637fddcf6bd85889a9336dfb","amp;dn":"The+Original+Wailers+-+Music+Lesson%2FNice+Time+-+12%5C%22+versi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"771f937800f60e2e637fddcf6bd85889a9336dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,31,147,120,0,246,14,46,99,127,221,207,107,216,88,137,169,51,109,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
