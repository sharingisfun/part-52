It was one of the first games to run only in Pentium or superior range of processors[citation needed] (for the PC version) but did not have a GPU requirement. The game soundtrack, composed by Tommy Tallarico, was also released.\n\nThe game tells the story of its protagonist, Kurt Hectic and his attempts to rescue Earth from an alien invasion of gigantic strip mining city-vehicles named &amp;#039;Minecrawlers&amp;#039;, which are not only removing all of earth&amp;#039;s natural resources but are also flattening any people and cities that get in their way. The game combined fast action with fully 3D rendered, state-of-the art (for the time) graphics and a warped sense of humour. It featured a &quot;sniper mode&quot; that allowed the player to zoom in on an enemy targets.\n\n\nI seed old games. :)\n\nThough I mostly have limited bandwith during daytime, but I run fullspeed in the nights. So don&amp;#039;t go whine over the speed.\n\n\nINCLUDES NO-CD CRACK!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a30c2921c0881d38c93f4b653c833cedefa16912","amp;dn":"MDK+%2B+NO-CD+Crack++-+MONTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a30c2921c0881d38c93f4b653c833cedefa16912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,12,41,33,192,136,29,56,201,63,75,101,60,131,60,237,239,161,105,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
