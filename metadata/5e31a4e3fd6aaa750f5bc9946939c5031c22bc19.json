In the very first level you are to find up to 32 numbers. \nAt the beginning everything goes pretty smoothly but it&amp;#039;s only till you find yourself stuck with the last one having no idea where it is. Plus the time is almost out. So, the game is fun. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e31a4e3fd6aaa750f5bc9946939c5031c22bc19","amp;dn":"MYSTERIEZ+%28HIDDEN+OBJECT+GAME%29+www.p2pworld.ulmb.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e31a4e3fd6aaa750f5bc9946939c5031c22bc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,49,164,227,253,106,170,117,15,91,201,148,105,57,197,3,28,34,188,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
