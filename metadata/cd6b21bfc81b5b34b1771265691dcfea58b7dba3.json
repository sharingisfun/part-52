His parents have separated, and he impulsively decides to spend the holidays with his dad, Peter, and his dad\\&amp;#039;s rich girlfriend, Natalie. Natalie lives in an unusual mansion - a \\&quot;smart house\\&quot; in which almost everything responds to remote commands: doors open and close at will, the chandelier rises and lowers, a swinging bookcase reveals a secret bar, etc. Even better, the frosty butler, Prescott, and sweet housekeeper, Molly, are at Kevin\\&amp;#039;s beck and call. But just as Kevin settles into his luxurious surroundings, Peter and Natalie leave to pick up some royal house guests at the airport, including an 11-year-old crown prince.In their absence, the devious Marv and Vera break in, intending to kidnap the crown prince. But they didn\\&amp;#039;t realize they\\&amp;#039;d be facing off with Kevin instead, and, while it may not be his house, he still has to protect it. With the help of the house\\&amp;#039;s high-tech wizardry, Kevin repeatedly thwarts them by turning the tables (and the swinging bookcases, shower jets and chandelier) on them. The antics build to a hilarious Christmas Day showdown in which everyone gets into the action during an unexpected reunion between Kevin and his parents, siblings, Natalie and the royal family. \n\n\nDirector............: Rod Daniel\n\nWriters.............: John Hughes \n                      Debra Frank \n\nCast................: French Stewart\n                      Erick Avari\n                      Barbara Babcock\n                      Jason Beghe\n                      Clare Carey\n                      Joanna Going\n                      Missi Pyle\n                      Gideon Jacobs\n                      Chelsea Russo\n                      Mike Weinberg\n                      Lisa King\n                      Sean Michael\n                      Craig Geldenhuys\n                      Andre Roothman\n                      Anton Smuts\n\nEnjoy This Movie\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd6b21bfc81b5b34b1771265691dcfea58b7dba3","amp;dn":"Home+Alone%3A+Taking+Back+the+House+%5B2002%5D+%2ADvD+License%2A+-+MauS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd6b21bfc81b5b34b1771265691dcfea58b7dba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,107,33,191,200,27,91,52,177,119,18,101,105,29,207,234,88,183,219,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
