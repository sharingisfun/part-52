B. Allender\n\nDiversified and relentlessly creative -- giving space to new artistic and emotional expression -- this second solo album from guitarist Adrian Belew expands upon his already remarkable solo debut, though more than a few will be confused and put off by the opener, the Beatles' classic &quot;I'm Down.&quot; Belew's inventiveness, both as a guitarist and as a songwriter, keep this album fresh and exciting at nearly every turn. One remarkable track, &quot;She Is Not Dead&quot; -- with lyrics sung over a backward version of &quot;Hot Sun&quot; from Lone Rhino -- has lyrics that fondly remember a departed loved one, astonishing in their beauty and depth of emotion. &quot;The Rail Song&quot; laments the disappearance of trains, referring to the rail system with the endearing pronoun &quot;she.&quot; Psychotic, manic-paced instrumental &quot;Paint the Road,&quot; utilizing Belew's signature MIDI guitar sounds, moves with a fury that will leave the listener gasping for breath. Musically still drawing from his experience with Talking Heads and Bowie, Belew is finding his own voice here and moving toward (though not completely capturing) a sound that is uniquely his.\n\n1 I'm Down \tLennon, McCartney \t2:56\n2 I Wonder \tBelew \t4:40\n3 Life Without a Cage \tBelew \t3:20\n4 Sexy Rhino \tBelew \t0:37\n5 Twang Bar King \tBelew \t1:26\n6 Another Time \tBelew \t3:05\n7 The Rail Song \tBelew \t5:41\n8 Paint the Road [instrumental] \tBelew \t3:20\n9 She Is Not Dead \tBelew \t4:42\n10 Fish Head \tBelew \t4:31\n11 The Ideal Woman \tBelew \t4:12\n12 Ballet for a Blue Whale [instrumental] \tBelew \t4:44\n\nNMR 192\nkind regards\npnp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ba6a4e2752e2badec608a56fb1f6fbe0f35ccf2","amp;dn":"Adrian+Belew+-+Twang+Bar+King+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ba6a4e2752e2badec608a56fb1f6fbe0f35ccf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,166,164,226,117,46,43,173,236,96,138,86,251,31,111,190,15,53,204,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
