A concept album in nature, Shapes is a somewhat of a song cycle based on the different shapes of the album cover. Each shape and connection between shapes corresponds to a track of the album, and the visual properties of the objects are represented in the music. The songs tend to be abstract and unique in production, but still musically interesting both melodically and in the use of complex harmonies. In addition, all of the tracks flow into each other, and the album effectively loops back on itself, corresponding to the picture.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://evilresidence.com/adhesion/shapes.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://evilresidence.com/adhesion/shapes.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a09cef6a9e94a4669f561ca6a19166fe524cf4","amp;dn":"Adhesion+-+Shapes+%5B2006%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a09cef6a9e94a4669f561ca6a19166fe524cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,160,156,239,106,158,148,164,102,159,86,28,166,161,145,102,254,82,76,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
