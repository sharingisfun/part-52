It includes an early recording by the Ides of March, who later changed their sound and scored a big hit with &quot;Vehicle&quot;; a track by Gary &amp; the Knight Lites, who later became the American Breed; and numerous selections from obscure '60s garage bands with some connections to the Windy City. While some of these bands may have been influenced by Chicago blues, they seem to have been more influenced by the British Invasion, Bob Dylan, other '60s garage bands, and '50s rock &amp; roll; indeed, the album features remakes of songs by the Who (&quot;I Can't Explain&quot;), the Rolling Stones (&quot;The Spider &amp; the Fly&quot;), the Animals (&quot;I'm Gonna Change&quot; and &quot;I'm Cryin'&quot;), the New Colony Six (&quot;At the River's Edge&quot;), the Vectors (&quot;It's Been a Day or Two&quot;), the Hombres (&quot;Let It All Hang Out&quot;), and Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith &amp; the Clowns (&quot;High Blood Pressure&quot;). As you may have guessed from the high number of cover versions, the bands on this compilation aren't strikingly original; this compilation, like Pebbles, Vol. 6, will appeal primarily to garage rock completists who are willing to forgive a few borrowed ideas in the pursuit of a good time. Note that &quot;Ben Franklin's Almanac&quot; by the Cryan Shames is not included on the CD even though it is included on the song list that's printed on the CD cover; the third song is actually &quot;Come With Me&quot; by the Boyz, which was incorrectly listed on the CD cover for Pebbles, Vol. 6.\n\nhttp://cover6.cduniverse.com/PhantomArt/105094.jpg\n\n Song Title\n1.\tOne Girl Man - The Lost Agency\n2.\tTake Me Back &amp; Hold Me - The Foggy Notions\n3.\tBen Franklin's Almanac - The Cryan Shames\n4.\tLittle Girl - The Revelles\n5.\tI Can't Explain - Oscar &amp; Majestics\n6.\tEvery Day &amp; Every Night - The Trolls\n7.\tSugar Shack A Go Go - The Children Of Darkness\n8.\tHigh Blood Pressure - The Factory\n9.\tSpider &amp; The Fly, The - Von Ruden\n10.\tI'll Keep Searching - The Ides Of March\n11.\tTake Me Back - Gary &amp; Knight Lites\n12.\tHanna - Bobby Brelyn\n13.\tI'm Gonna Change The World - The Commons, Ltd\n14.\tEchoes - Lord &amp; The Flies\n15.\tWhat In The World - The Berries\n16.\tIt's Been A Day Or Two - The Vectors\n17.\tI'm Cryin' - The Malibus\n18.\tGo Go Baby - The Cardinals\n29.\tShame - Wet Paint\n20.\tAt The River's Edge - Wet Paint\n21.\tI Still Care For You - Jimmy Null &amp; The Iversions\n22.\tTime to Dream - The Lost Agency\n23.\tLet It All Hang Out - Barney Pip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39576b668b965bc71a21069505241253ffe365a6","amp;dn":"Various+Artists-Pebbles+Vol.7-Chicago+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39576b668b965bc71a21069505241253ffe365a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,87,107,102,139,150,91,199,26,33,6,149,5,36,18,83,255,227,101,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
