And Each Month To Boot!\n\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\nVox ATC X\n\nHelgoLand\n\nAirport Facilitator X\n\nPLUS\n\nHorton&amp;#039;s Hints For FSX\n\nNews and New Releases\n\nPull Out Poster\n\nVirtual Aviator\n\nFreeware Frenzy\n\nSPIN &amp; STALL RECOVERY\nThe title of this article indicates that we are going to recap spins and expand on stalls. Since the stall is always preceded by a spin letÃƒÂ¢??s also recap stalls covered in previous CP articles.\n\nFlying Green with Farmboyzim - Greenland \nHere we go, off on another of ÃƒÂ¢??FarmboyzimÃƒÂ¢??s Green FlightsÃƒÂ¢??. These are flights in areas around this big blue marble of ours we live on which deserve attention, in both the real world and the simulated world. This time around, we are going to head over to Greenland, and see for ourselves (virtually of course), just what is going on with the North Polar Ice Pack and the Ice Sheet that covers Greenland.\n\nMaking it Real: Real ATC ÃƒÂ¢?? The Next Big Thing \nÃƒÂ¢??If youÃƒÂ¢??ve been flying MS flight simulator for as long as I have, thereÃƒÂ¢??s no doubt you already take real weather for granted. Now you can uncover the boundless possibilities of integrating real ATC into you flight sim experienceÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢??\n\nMeet Your Makers - Burkhard Renk \n&quot;When I say ÃƒÂ¢??MyTrafficÃƒÂ¢?? I am sure many of you will have the ÃƒÂ¢??ahaÃƒÂ¢?? experience. Of course you know MyTraffic (and perhaps the MyWorld mesh and landclass series?). And after reading this interview, youÃƒÂ¢??ll also know its creator, Burkhard Renk.&quot; \n\nBringing Out FSX \nWhile Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) is a magnificent advance over prior versions in many respects, itÃƒÂ¢??s also an enormous burden on typical home computers. For it to work properly, most users must upgrade their systems at costs exceeding the basic programÃƒÂ¢??s retail value by several times. And it still has many shortcomings carried over from prior versions. \n\nCustomizing Airport Facilities Data \nFor many users, recent versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator have been more than flight simulators; theyÃƒÂ¢??ve been ÃƒÂ¢??world of aviationÃƒÂ¢?? simulators! Particularly with the addition of animated jetways and moving airport service vehicles in FSX, users can visualize more realistic airport operations in Flight Simulator than ever before. This article discusses commercial and freeware tools now available for customizing airports.\n\nDr Betzy Wong, Flight Sim Therapist ÃƒÂ¢?? Session II \nI was awestruck! Never in my life had I been in the same room as a real life uniformed airline pilot. And she was right there in the waiting room of Dr WongÃƒÂ¢??s office. Although she looked pretty old to me (about 40) I still thought that she looked quite beautiful. Suddenly, all of my suspicions about Dr WongÃƒÂ¢??s bona fides simply melted away.\n\nFlight Simulator X vs Quad Core \nHow does FSX run on a Quad Core machine? David Smith finds out! \n\nVFR Flying in the Water Wonderland ÃƒÂ¢?? Part II \nÃƒÂ¢??In Part 1 I said I would fly the default FSX Beaver. I changed my mind because it is not an amphibian. When you fly in the upper peninsula of Michigan you really need an amphibian aircraft.ÃƒÂ¢??","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df4f470967941a78fa58bd7b00b80c1b3a8e8139","amp;dn":"FS2004+%26+FSX+-+Computer+Pilot+-+November+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df4f470967941a78fa58bd7b00b80c1b3a8e8139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,79,71,9,103,148,26,120,250,88,189,123,0,184,12,27,58,142,129,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
