If you stop seeding before your ratio is above one, you&amp;#039;re being lazy.\n\n\n\n\n\nA film about two homicide detectives&amp;#039; desperate hunt for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the world&amp;#039;s ignorance of the Seven Deadly Sins. The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one victim to the next as the sociopathic &quot;John Doe&quot; sermonizes to Detectives Sommerset and Mills -- one sin at a time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer&amp;#039;s terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and cultured Sommerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer&amp;#039;s modus operandi while green Detective Mills scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...

His twisted agenda involves choosing seven victims who represent egregious examples of transgressions of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. He then views himself as akin to the Sword of God, handing out horrific punishment to these sinners. Two cops, an experienced veteran of the streets who is about to retire and the ambitious young homocide detective hired to replace him, team up to capture the perpetrator of these gruesome killings. Unfortunately, they too become ensnared in his diabolical plan...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88d36ae92553397506dafd54b581c613222aeb1d","amp;dn":"Se7en%28iPod+optimised%29-Bradart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88d36ae92553397506dafd54b581c613222aeb1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,211,106,233,37,83,57,117,6,218,253,84,181,129,198,19,34,42,235,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
