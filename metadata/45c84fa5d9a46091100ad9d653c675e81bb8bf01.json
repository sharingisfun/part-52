The sound on this recording lays out the formula that Frampton would take to mega-success three years later with the release of Frampton Comes Alive. The songs are all first-rate or close to it -- included here is the original studio version of the group composition &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do,&quot; a quicker-tempo, extended (albeit less majestic) version of which appeared on the latter album and became a staple of classic-rock radio, but the Frampton-composed &quot;I Got My Eyes on You&quot; and &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Fade Away&quot; and the Frampton-Gallagher &quot;All Night Long&quot; are also compelling examples of &amp;#039;70s hard rock at its commercial best. This album also includes a nice cover of Stevie Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;I Believe (When I Fall in Love With You It Will Be Forever),&quot; the power ballad &quot;Lines on My Face,&quot; the rollicking &quot;White Sugar,&quot; and Frampton&amp;#039;s gorgeously lyrical, all acoustic &quot;Just the Time of the Year.&quot; As on Wind of Change, Frampton&amp;#039;s use of dynamics and mix of acoustic and electric guitars keeps the music from becoming one-dimensional.
