For those codecs that require a license that cannot be distributed, GOM will automatically lead you to an open-source codec web-site. \n\n\nPlays Broken Files\n\nWatch video files while you are downloading them! GOM has a registered patent for playing broken AVI files and files that are still being downloaded. So try one of your broken AVI files or one that you are downloading right now. You&amp;#039;ll find it amazing! \n\n\nEnjoy Advanced Features\n\nGOM supports a lot of advanced features for advanced users. You can customize the player by creating your own skin, setting toggle keys, VMR modes, detailed resolution among others. It also provides features such as an overlay mixer, real-time index rebuilding for AVI files, unicode support, key frame based RW/FF and many more! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ff55b78b857b5f4055e38f9f49a6a63848676c","amp;dn":"Gom+Media+Player","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ff55b78b857b5f4055e38f9f49a6a63848676c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,255,85,183,139,133,123,95,64,85,227,143,159,73,166,166,56,72,103,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
