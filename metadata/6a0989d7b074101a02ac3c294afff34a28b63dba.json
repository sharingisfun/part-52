As part of the trip we went to the NSA, which is virtually closed off to visitors.  While there, all the students were given a recruitment CD (business card size).  I decided to post the contents of this CD online for anyone who is interested.  Open Recruit_2004.exe to view the presentation.\n\nI added the CD Cover.jpg file, but everything else in the archive is the original stuff from the CD.  Sorry about the poor image quality, but it's the best I could muster.  The hard to read text on the right says &quot;PC Platform.  Place in TRAY loading.  CD-ROM Drives ONLY.&quot;  And the indecipherable message at the bottom reads &quot;CD may not work in all machines.  U.S. Government NOT liable for misuse.&quot;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a0989d7b074101a02ac3c294afff34a28b63dba","amp;dn":"NSA+Recruitment+2005+%28Promo+CD%29.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a0989d7b074101a02ac3c294afff34a28b63dba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,9,137,215,176,116,16,26,2,172,60,41,74,255,243,74,40,182,61,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
