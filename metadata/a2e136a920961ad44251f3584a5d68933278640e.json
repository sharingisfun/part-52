The beauty and sheer power of the cosmos is unleashed on screen using \nastonishing images from telescopes around the world and in space itself.  \n\nSpaceÃƒÂ¢??s unique concept - a Virtual Space Zone set deep in the mountains of New Zealand \n-  allows Sam Neill to interact directly with a virtual universe, throwing a stone and \nwatching it become the asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs, wading into the Galaxy \nto watch a black hole guzzle the Earth and holding a star in the palm of his hand.   \n\nÃƒÂ¢??This is the story of our quest to find out where we all came fromÃƒÂ¢?? says Sam Neill, who \nstars in the soon-to-be-released Jurassic Park III.  ÃƒÂ¢??ItÃƒÂ¢??s about the magic of space - that \namazing moment weÃƒÂ¢??ve all experienced when we look up at the stars and ask ourselves \nÃƒÂ¢??where did we come from?ÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??are we alone ?ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??\n\nThe series meets scientists and experts who are exploring some of the profoundest \nquestions we can ask ourselves and listens to some of their earth-shattering answers.   \n\nIn Star Stuff  we learn that all life on Earth, including humans, comes from outer space - \nevery single molecule of our bodies originates from an unimaginably large hydrogen \ncloud created by the Big Bang, and there are even serious claims that life was carried to \nearth by meteors.\n\nStaying Alive shows just how dangerous the Universe continues to be. Life on Earth has \nbeen nearly eradicated on twenty occasions by massive asteroids, most dramatically \ncausing the extinction of dinosaurs.  Another cataclysm is due any time now.  \nEven if we avoid destruction by asteroids, we face eventual melt-down, as our Sun is \ngetting progressively hotter. New Worlds looks at where we could go to escape this fate \nand talks to scientists who are already exploring how we could turn a planet like Mars \ninto a NoahÃƒÂ¢??s ark for the earthÃƒÂ¢??s animal and plant life.  It may even be that humans have \nto change themselves genetically to survive.\n\nBlack Holes are the UniverseÃƒÂ¢??s ultimate monsters, sucking everything into their super-\ndense centres.  There are an estimated ten million of these cosmic killers in our galaxy, \nand once created they never die. What are the chances of Earth having a fatal encounter ?\n\nAre We Alone looks at the possibility of extraterrestrial life and visits SETI, a scientific \nproject that for the past 40 years has been searching for information beamed from \nintelligent life in other solar systems.\n\nIf humans are ever to reach deep space, thereÃƒÂ¢??ll need to be some revolutionary changes in \ntransport.  Boldly Go demonstrates how ion propulsion and solar sails may become \neffective means to galaxy-hop, and considers ÃƒÂ¢??worm holesÃƒÂ¢?? as ways to cheat time and \nspace.\n\nSpace whisks viewers across the globe to meet scientists at the cutting edge of space \ntechnology.  People like Professor Paul Drake who recreates exploding stars in his \nlaboratory; Lawrence Krauss, an astrophysicist and science advisor to Star Trek; Jeff \nWynn, a geologist who tracks down asteroid craters on Earth; Seth Shostak who searches \nfor extraterrestrial life at the SETI Institute; Penny Boston, a scientist who has found life \nin the most inhospitable places on earth, increasing our hopes of finding life on Mars; \n\nRobert Zubrin who is developing biospheres to enable humans to live on Mars; David \nBrin, a science fiction writer who believes we may have to change genetically to survive \nnew worlds; Dr Marc Rayman, a NASA scientist working on ion propulsion; Professor \nBrian Boyle who has already mapped out 75,000 galaxies in the Universe, and was the \nfirst person, with his team, to watch a black hole being created; Professor Peter Coles, a \ncosmologist who believes tunnels through space could be created to travel anywhere \ninstantly; and Story Musgrave, an astronaut whose working day involves satellite \nmaintenance thousands of feet about Earth.   \n\nÃƒÂ¢??My aim in making this series is to inspire viewers who think science is a bore,ÃƒÂ¢?? says \naward-winning series producer, Richard Burke Ward.  ÃƒÂ¢??Space is about our relationship \nwith the Universe - how the things which go on ÃƒÂ¢??up thereÃƒÂ¢?? really do affect our lives on \nEarth.  If you think the Universe is a big irrelevance, Space will make you think again.ÃƒÂ¢??  \n\nSpace is a BBC co-production with The Learning Channel.\n\nThere is a BBC book to accompany the series, together with a video and DVD (available \nlater this year).   The BBC Space website will feature an exciting 3D tour of the solar \nsystem, online games, e-cards from the series and other intergalactic fun.          \n\nLog on to www.bbc.co.uk/space\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e136a920961ad44251f3584a5d68933278640e","amp;dn":"Space+with+Sam+Neill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e136a920961ad44251f3584a5d68933278640e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,225,54,169,32,150,26,212,66,81,243,88,74,93,104,147,50,120,100,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
