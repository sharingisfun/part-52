They had lost, and the Navajo Indians were forced to live on reservations where U.S. policy tried to strip them of their heritage and history. Yet, when World War II thrust the nation into its hour of need, young Navajo soldiers responded with one of the most important, secret and least heralded accomplishments of the conflict.\n\nNAVAJO CODE TALKERS tells the incredible story of the only unbroken code in modern military history Navajo soldiers weaved their ancient language into a cipher that the enemies were unable to break. Numerous interviews with surviving code talkers illuminates their role, heroism and motivations. See how their legacy affects the Navajo people today and how the code they devised has served America since WWII.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Search-History-Navajo-Talkers-Channel/dp/B000CSTK74&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Search-History-Navajo-Talkers-Channel/dp/B000CSTK74&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRuntime 50 mins\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34b702fc714a39a1b5fcb2bf52354124689bd767","amp;dn":"History+Channel+WWII+Navajo+Codetalkers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34b702fc714a39a1b5fcb2bf52354124689bd767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,183,2,252,113,74,57,161,181,252,178,191,82,53,65,36,104,155,215,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
