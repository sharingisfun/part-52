Shy at first, as the show progress&amp;#039;s on he becomes more friendly, just like his songs. Starting off as something very simple, and progress within a short period of time to something beautiful and nothing short of genius.\n\nHis most recent release Uncorked Understandings was a progression from his previous release, a split with local The Salt. My suggestion for listening from that CD is the whole CD from start to finish.... in one word, beautiful.&quot;\n\n\n\nTHIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE!\nTo visit the collective:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://001collective.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://001collective.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo visit the artist&amp;#039;s myspace:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://myspace.com/awonderful&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://myspace.com/awonderful&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d1897f4fd37d82127577dccd0ee134a64ec01d9","amp;dn":"A+Wonderful+-+Uncorked+Understandings+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d1897f4fd37d82127577dccd0ee134a64ec01d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,24,151,244,253,55,216,33,39,87,125,204,208,238,19,74,100,236,1,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
