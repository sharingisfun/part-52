You\\&amp;#039;ll be given 500 credits for a start and drawn 5 cards from which you can choose to hold the cards. The ones you did not hold will be replaced. In case of the win you\\&amp;#039;ll be given an option to cash out or double the win by guessing the rank of the next card.\n\nThe game is really simple but yet entertaining.
