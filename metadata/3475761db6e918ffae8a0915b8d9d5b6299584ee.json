Unique Documentary about People who are Pipers \nThousands of people play the bagpipes, but who are these people? THEY PIPE AMONG US is a documentary that sifts through the legions of players and gets to know a few of the interesting. Fifteen pipers will be profiled during the program, which culminates with the formation of a pipe band from among the people profiled. The band plays its one and only gig at the Canadian curling championship hip in March 2002. The audience will learn to be a pipe band along with the pipers. \n\nTHE PIPE AMONG US opens in a lively pub. The pipe major (Bethany Bisaillion) and the 14 members of her pipe band are sitting in a group, sipping scotch and beer, talking about the Great Highland bagpipes and telling funny piping stories. It is a casual group of people, apparently good friends. \n\nAs the program continues, we come to understand that, in fact, this is the first time they have ever met, and yet they are as familiar as family. ThatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s the pipes. It is what bonds these people and allows them t jump right past social awkwardness to the intimacy of musical kinship. \n\nThe documentary introduces the audience to this diverse group, and as we get to know them, we start to cheer for them to succeed. They face a difficult task, evolving from a group of strangers to a competition-ready pipe band. These are people from all walks of life and backgrounds - among the players are a blind piper, a forensic pathologist, a prison guard , an astrophysicist and a General John de Chastelain, a man trying to bring peace to Ireland, who has flown in for this. \n\nThroughout the documentary the audience shares in the monumental effort of the pipers, as they struggle with unfamiliar music and surroundings to produce a concert ready sound. The program also visits each of the pipers in their own environment, at home or at work, to find out who they are and why they feel such a passion for the bagpipes. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3475761db6e918ffae8a0915b8d9d5b6299584ee","amp;dn":"The+Pipe+Among+Us.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3475761db6e918ffae8a0915b8d9d5b6299584ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,117,118,29,182,233,24,255,174,138,9,21,184,217,213,182,41,149,132,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
