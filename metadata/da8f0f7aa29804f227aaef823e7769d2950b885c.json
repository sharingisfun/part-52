Kingman&amp;#039;s world is turned upside-down, however, when a young girl named Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) appears from out of the blue, claiming to be his daughter from a brief former marriage. Reluctantly, Kingman must learn how to shake his self-absorption and become a father, leading to hijinks that involve the inevitable clash of macho-man and little-girl cultures. Directed by Andy Fickman (SHE&amp;#039;S THE MAN), this likable Disney movie is hoisted up by the muscular Johnson, who finally gets a chance to showcase his winking charm and impressive comic timing at length. Although Johnson is no stranger to portraying football players (see 2006&amp;#039;s GRIDIRON GANG), THE GAME PLAN is far lighter fare than his previous films, opening up at another door in his intriguing WWE-to-Hollywood career. The comedy also features an excellent supporting cast, most notably, the precocious Pettis, along with Morris Chestnut, who plays KingmanÃƒÂ¢??s thoughtful teammate Travis Sanders, and Kyra Sedgwick, on leave from her hard-hitting role in THE CLOSER TV show as KingmanÃƒÂ¢??s workaholic agent. Nodding to Disney live-action comedies of yore while conveying a 21st-century sheen, THE GAME PLAN hits all of its intended goals, making it one of 2007ÃƒÂ¢??s most enjoyable family movies. \n\nWhen it has to be done right the first time \n\nBurner.rr \n\nLok for all my up comming releases","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da8f0f7aa29804f227aaef823e7769d2950b885c","amp;dn":"The+game+plan+2007+By+Burner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da8f0f7aa29804f227aaef823e7769d2950b885c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,143,15,122,162,152,4,242,39,170,239,130,62,119,105,210,149,11,136,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
