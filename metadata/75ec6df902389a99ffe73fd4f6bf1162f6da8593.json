Again, like &amp;#039;Feel The Fire&amp;#039;, apart from the fact that this album is from &quot;Good Groove&amp;#039;s Vinyl Collection&quot;, I can offer no additional information about the source.  This time, it&amp;#039;s encoded as a VBR MP3, which is all the better.  \n\nIf anyone has any other album requests that I might be able to handle, feel free to let me know and I&amp;#039;ll see what I can do.  In the meantime, please enjoy this album, and as always, please help seed once your download is completed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ec6df902389a99ffe73fd4f6bf1162f6da8593","amp;dn":"Claudja+Barry+-+Sweet+Dynamite+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ec6df902389a99ffe73fd4f6bf1162f6da8593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,236,109,249,2,56,154,153,255,231,63,212,246,191,17,98,246,218,133,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
