These be terrible times in the kingdom of Bruno the Questionable! At the darkest hour of the Dark Ages, the dreaded Jabberwock roams the land. His eyes aflame, his talons bared, a bone-crushing horror! Which brave knight shall slay the beast and save the kingdom? Who shall win the hand of the fair princess?

Or will he be smitten with chamberpots and made to eat rats on a stick?
