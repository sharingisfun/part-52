They carry goods from China, fuel to \nChina and US war supplies to the Middle East. Piracy is rife: in \n2003, 445 ships were attacked and 93 people were killed. This \ndocumentary examines how the conditions in the impoverished islands \nof Indonesia have been used by piracy as the perfect base. The \nprogram seeks to unveil who is involved, how they go about their \nbusiness and how the laissez-faire attitude of the authorities has \nallowed piracy to continue. Piracy In The Straits also looks at \nwhat might happen if these pirates are recruited by terrorists. \nTugs and barges have already been kidnapped by pirates and filled \nwith mines, while a chemical tanker has been kidnapped by pirates \nin order to know more about its navigational capabilities. The \nprogram also looks at what the consequences would be if a tanker \nwere taken over by terrorists and blown up in Singapore, the \nworld&amp;#039;s largest port. \n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Piracy In The Straits (2005-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 349 MB (or 358,362 KB or 366,962,688 bytes)\nFrames.......: 512x384 (1.33:1) [=4:3] @ 0.165 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 809 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52c6d74f02d94fd570d6b68d6f318b9c4b4a4762","amp;dn":"Piracy+In+The+Straits+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52c6d74f02d94fd570d6b68d6f318b9c4b4a4762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,198,215,79,2,217,79,213,112,214,182,141,111,49,139,156,75,74,71,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
