Click continue, and it should verify and take you to the menu (if not, you may need to have some form of media in your CD drive just to make it think the CoH disc is actually inserted). \n\nIf you do not have Opposing Fronts installed, you can still unlock the extra races (British + Panzer) by selecting to play the extra campaigns, and when prompted, entering the following key:\n \n4825-03cf-668e-1765-fd43\n\nAnd there you have it - one fully operational, up-to-date game - with extra playable races :D\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91d07de8755535e803535bc493c9acdfd3e790da","amp;dn":"Patches+for+Company+Of+Heroes+%26+Opposing+Fronts+Expansion+%2B+Crac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91d07de8755535e803535bc493c9acdfd3e790da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,208,125,232,117,85,53,232,3,83,91,196,147,201,172,223,211,231,144,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
