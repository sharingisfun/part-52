Academy AwardÃ‚Â« nominee Peter O&amp;#039;Toole plays Swann. Once a swashbuckling movie idol whose face was plastered on fan magazines, Swann is now mostly plastered. And it falls to &amp;#039;Cavalcade&amp;#039;s&amp;#039; rookie writer (Mark Linn-Baker) to keep him on the sober and narrow. Don&amp;#039;t touch that dial.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0397a7863447c24c0f11579ec6c14d0952d06df0","amp;dn":"My+Favorite+Year","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0397a7863447c24c0f11579ec6c14d0952d06df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,151,167,134,52,71,194,76,15,17,87,158,198,193,77,9,82,208,109,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
