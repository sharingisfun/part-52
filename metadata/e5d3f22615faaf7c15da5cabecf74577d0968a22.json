Jeremy Blount (Bass) and Jon Riefler (Guitar)\ndecided to leave their old band during the winter of 2001 and\njoin forces with Nik Sherman (Guitar), their engineer at the\ntime, to start another band with dreams of endless success.\nAdding Ken Sarracino (Vocals) and Steve Kuhn (Drums) to the\nalready determined trio, the band was on the much anticipated\nroad to national recognition. With the ability to write songs\nthat just won&amp;AElig;t leave your head, the bands repertoire quickly\nexpanded as everyone added the IOV touch.\n\nIn a relatively short amount of time, IOV&amp;AElig;s fan base quickly\ngrew to proportions that made the dream turn to reality.\nPlaying alongside such acts as Lucky Boys Confusion, Prevent\nFalls, Ok Go, and The K-Word only helped them to get their\nname out. Filling out the Recher Theatre, Fletcher&amp;AElig;s, the\nVault, and the Ottobar (to name a few) helped the band sell a\nlarge number of their debut self released CD.\n\nThe &amp;ocirc;IOV Formula&amp;ouml; has created endless possibility for this\ngroup of guys as their success continues to grow. Recently\nbeing picked up by Undecided Records with an attached\npromotion and distribution deal through Victory Records and\nSony Entertainment, only shows further promise for the band. A\nformer engineer had this to say, &amp;ocirc;Isle of View is like a\ntackle box, they are full of hooks.&amp;ouml; Keep an eye and an ear\nout for Isle of View in your world, as you won&amp;AElig;t be\ndisappointed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5d3f22615faaf7c15da5cabecf74577d0968a22","amp;dn":"Isle_Of_View-Gentle_Firefly_Radio-2005-RTB+%5BPunk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5d3f22615faaf7c15da5cabecf74577d0968a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,211,242,38,21,250,175,124,21,218,92,171,236,247,69,119,208,150,138,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
