It uses pc_efi to start the process so there is no need for patching and post-patching.\n\nIf you have a machine with NFORCE or ATI chips, then this download is not for you. I encourage y&amp;#039;all to go with nVidia and Intel... There is a reason that Apple did.\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b9f7538d8dce95ae2520bad7a8e4b2c1fbdc2cd","amp;dn":"Bc-Girl%5C%27s+Mac+OS+X+Install+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b9f7538d8dce95ae2520bad7a8e4b2c1fbdc2cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,159,117,56,216,220,233,90,226,82,11,173,122,142,75,44,31,189,194,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
