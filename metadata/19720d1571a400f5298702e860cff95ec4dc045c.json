Modern manufacturing techniques\nwould be embraced and used to advantage, but\nassembly, fit and finish could only depend on\npracticed hands. There would be no compromise in\nfeatures, materials or performance.\nRimfire rifles led the way, followed by centerfire\nrifles, pistols and finally shotguns. As new models\nwere introduced more shooters and hunters were\nattracted by classic lines, dependability and accuracy.\nIn turn, demand fueled growth and encouraged\ncontinual product improvement.\nToday more than ever, the reputation of the Kimber\nbrand reflects the original purpose ? and Kimber\nis known as America?s leading manufacturer of\npremium production firearms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19720d1571a400f5298702e860cff95ec4dc045c","amp;dn":"Kimber+Classic+Firearms.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19720d1571a400f5298702e860cff95ec4dc045c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,114,13,21,113,164,0,245,41,135,2,232,96,207,249,94,196,220,4,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
