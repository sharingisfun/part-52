This is the follow up to 1998 album In Search of Charm which was by far a great album.  Lonesome High has some excellent melodies that seem to creep up on you while listening and slowly work their way into your conscious.  Well known for their stunning live performances and amazing atmospheric grooves.  Angler&amp;#039;s music is a combination of electronic / loose beats / twangy guitar riffs.  \n-RS\n\nCD is ripped at 192kbps and is in .mp3 format.\n\nAngler -  Lonesome High (1999)\n\n1. last vendetta - beautiful thing (for Lee).mp3\n2. guts.mp3\n3. seduction of an old flame.mp3\n4. born in a hill.mp3\n5. lonesome high.mp3\n6. take a look around.mp3\n7. brush with death.mp3\n8. the salmon feed at night.mp3\n9. lullaby with still life.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32ffe65b88f2e49b573aaa8f8f535e1f3c45db3","amp;dn":"Angler+-+Lonesome+High","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32ffe65b88f2e49b573aaa8f8f535e1f3c45db3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,47,254,101,184,143,46,73,181,115,170,168,248,245,53,225,243,196,93,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
