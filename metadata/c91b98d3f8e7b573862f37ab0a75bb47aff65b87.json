The movie is a semi-fictional account of the BOPE (Portuguese: BatalhÃƒÂ£o de OperaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes Policiais Especiais), the Special Police Operations Battalion of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police. It is the second feature film and first fiction film of director JosÃƒÂ© Padilha, who had previously directed the acclaimed documentary Bus 174. The script was written by Academy Award-nominated screenwriter BrÃƒÂ¡ulio Mantovani, based on the book Elite da Tropa by sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two former BOPE captains, AndrÃƒÂ© Batista and Rodrigo Pimentel.\nThe movie, set in 1997, depicts the story of Captain Nascimento, a BOPE captain, who with the imminent birth of his first child, is determined to leave the battalion and find a safer position for the sake of his family, but first he must find a suitable replacement for him. At the same time, the movie focuses on two childhood friends, Matias and Neto, who become cadets in the military police, but become dismayed at the corruption surrounding them. Eventually both Nascimento and the cadets&amp;#039; paths intersect, when the captain hopes that one of the two may become the substitute he is eager to find, as both decide to join the BOPE.\n\n---\nJeden z najbardziej kontrowersyjnych filmÃƒÂ³w w historii kina brazylijskiego.
