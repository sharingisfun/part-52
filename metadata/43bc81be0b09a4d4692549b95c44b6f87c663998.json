Interviewed people include Ron Paul, Al Sharpton, Janice Dickinson, Larry King, Nancy Grace, and others.\n\nSpecial programming includes Exposed: The Extremist Agenda, Exposed: The Climate of Fear, and a weeklong series titled America&amp;#039;s Addiction, about pornography. These programs don&amp;#039;t tend to include the usual humor and sarcasm used in Beck&amp;#039;s shows, presumably due to the largely serious nature of the content of these programs.\n\n\nExposed: The Extremist Agenda\nThe Extremist Agenda, aired in November 2006, which overviewed terrorism in the Middle East.\n\n\nExposed: The Climate of Fear\nThe May 2, 2007 edition of his Glenn Beck on Headline News was a &quot;special report&quot; entitled, &quot;Exposed: The Climate of Fear&quot;. In his opening remarks, Beck said, &quot;Welcome to exposed, the climate of fear. I want you to know right up front, this is not a balanced look at global warming. It is the other side of the climate debate that you don&amp;#039;t hear anywhere. Yes, Al Gore, there is another credible side.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43bc81be0b09a4d4692549b95c44b6f87c663998","amp;dn":"Glenn+Beck+-+Ron+Paul+Interview+-+2007.12.18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43bc81be0b09a4d4692549b95c44b6f87c663998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,188,129,190,11,9,164,212,105,37,73,185,92,68,182,248,124,102,57,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
