Usually the game is only available on beta weekends, but not anymore. Run this program before running Audiosurf. If Audiosurf asks to update, REFUSE or you will mess up your Audiosurf copy. When asked to log in, punch in anything, your username will become Mothball and it will allow you to play.\n\nDO NOT run this program while running Skype. They conflict, and you get some kind of port 80 error. Just shut off Skype, then run Audiosurfboard, and it&amp;#039;ll work fine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:266cf6be9b834e79422bc226994be9d145f798d9","amp;dn":"Audiosurfboard+%28AudioSurf+OFFLINE+PATCH%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"266cf6be9b834e79422bc226994be9d145f798d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,108,246,190,155,131,78,121,66,43,194,38,153,75,233,209,69,247,152,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
