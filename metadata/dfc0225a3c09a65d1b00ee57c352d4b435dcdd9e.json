The film stars Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange. It involves a two-bit lawyer getting caught up in his own scams as he attempts to make it in the seedy world of sports promoting. It departs from the source novel and the original film version by substituting the sport of pro wrestling, which was by the early 1990s targeted mostly at children, with boxing.\n\nAUDIO: English, Spanish\nSUBS: Spanish\n\nVIDEO: PAL 1.33:1 4/3\n\nDVD9 FULL\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc0225a3c09a65d1b00ee57c352d4b435dcdd9e","amp;dn":"The+night+and+the+city+%28La+noche+y+la+ciudad%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc0225a3c09a65d1b00ee57c352d4b435dcdd9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,192,34,90,60,9,166,93,27,0,238,87,195,82,212,180,53,220,221,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
