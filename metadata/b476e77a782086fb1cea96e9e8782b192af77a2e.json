I used to be a spy until (a phone rings telling him he&amp;#039;s been burned), when you&amp;#039;re burned, you&amp;#039;ve got nothing ? no cash, no credit, no job history. You&amp;#039;re stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. You do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who&amp;#039;s still talking to you. A trigger happy ex-girlfriend, a old friend who&amp;#039;s informing on you to the FBI. Family too, If your desperate. Bottom line, until you figure out who burned you. Your not going any where.&quot;\n    ?
