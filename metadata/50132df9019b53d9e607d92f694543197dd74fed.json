They come from JÃƒÂ¶nkÃƒÂ¶ping, Sweden, which is the place\nwere most of their gigs take place.\n\nThey started rehearsing their songs and after a while\nthey got their first gig at &quot;Nordisk GÃƒÂ¥rdsbandsfestival&quot;\nin JÃƒÂ¶nkÃƒÂ¶ping. The first gig was followes by a few months\nwithout any gigs. At their next gig they introduced some\nnew songs. \n\nModule&amp;#039;s first demo was recorded in February 2006. The\ntape included four songs. &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Johnny Who&quot;,\n&quot;Voice on the Radio&quot; and &quot;Spin the Wheel of Time&quot;.\nLater that year came an extended version of &quot;Voice on the\nRadio&quot;, the new songs &quot;Jetplane to Monaco&quot; and &quot;Pulse&quot;.\n\nA short time after the performance at &quot;Ung Kraft 2006&quot; Henrik\nMyntti decided to leave the band. Although being one band-\nmember short Module managed to maintain their sound.\nIn 2006 the number of gigs increased and kept increasing \neven more during 2007. \n\n2008 started with a release of their new demo &quot;Throw it at the\nWall&quot; including &quot;Burn&quot;, &quot;Running Away&quot;, &quot;Take A Dive&quot;, &quot;Rollin&amp;#039;\nRock&quot; and the titletrack(??) &quot;Throw it at the Wall&quot;. \nUnfortunatley they did not have enough time in the studio to\nmake &quot;Opportunity Goes Away&quot; justice. We will just have to wait\nand see if it appears on their next demo or if the next one will\nbe filled with the new songs they are working at.\n\nHopefully 2008 will be a good year for Module with a lot more\ngigs than 2007. Module&amp;#039;s reputation has increased over the years\nwhich easily could be seen by looking at the larger crouds at\ntheir gigs with &quot;vÃƒÂ¤tterfesten 2007&quot; as their most outstanding\nperformance.\n\n\nVisit:\nwww.modulerock.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50132df9019b53d9e607d92f694543197dd74fed","amp;dn":"Module+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50132df9019b53d9e607d92f694543197dd74fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,19,45,249,1,155,83,217,230,7,217,47,105,69,67,25,125,215,79,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
