Bali Agung features field recordings of Balinese chant mixed with synth atmospherics and drumming from the great Pete York.  Meditation is dark total synth music that gets very deep.  Sky Music_Mountain Music is more straight synth but in a lighter, mellower and delightfully spacey vein.  Bali Agung was ripped from my 15 year old and fairly pristine vinyl.  Mediation and Sky/Mountain were copied from my 15-20 year old cassettes and the sound is quiet good.\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb808e5b4434eceba272b532bf973fda578fbed4","amp;dn":"Eberhard+Schoener+3+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb808e5b4434eceba272b532bf973fda578fbed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,128,142,91,68,52,236,235,162,114,181,50,191,151,63,218,87,143,190,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
