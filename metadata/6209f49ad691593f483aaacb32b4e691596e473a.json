At the time, I didn&amp;#039;t have any, but after searching a few non-torrent sources, I came across this album.  The ID3 tags indicate that this album is from &quot;Good Groove&amp;#039;s Vinyl Collection&quot;, but aside from that, I can&amp;#039;t offer any information.  It&amp;#039;s encoded at an okay 192kbps, and judging by  the snippits I&amp;#039;ve listened to, it sounds alright.  \nI&amp;#039;m currently in the process of obtaining the 1977 album Sweet Dynamite, and I&amp;#039;ll upload it as soon as I can.\nAgain, enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6209f49ad691593f483aaacb32b4e691596e473a","amp;dn":"Claudja+Barry+-+Feel+The+Fire+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6209f49ad691593f483aaacb32b4e691596e473a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,9,244,154,214,145,89,63,72,58,170,203,50,180,230,145,89,110,71,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
