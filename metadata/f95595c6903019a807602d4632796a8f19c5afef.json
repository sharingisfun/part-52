Being the first metal band (confirmation please, I think it was them or Sarcofago) from Brazil to gain international recognition you know they gotta be kickass. They first started as described above, a death/thrash band, but since \\&quot;Chaos A.D.\\&quot; they started playing groove metal with tribal influences. Since Max\\&amp;#039;s departure, Sepultura has failed to attain success with singer/guitarist Derrick Green, not that it\\&amp;#039;s his fault. Now it seems Igor (or Iggor as he prefers it) has left the band to form Cavalera Conspiracy with his brother.\n\nAnyway, Sepultura returns with their second LP \\&quot;Schizophrenia\\&quot;. This album was the first to feature Andreas Kisser, who was originally Max\\&amp;#039;s roadie, on guitars. From that first riff in \\&quot;From the Past Comes the Storms\\&quot; you know this album pretty much owns your soul. The album never let you rest until the pretty much unnecessary instrumental \\&quot;The Abyss\\&quot;. \\&quot;Inquisition Symphony\\&quot; is instrumental thrash at its best at 7 minutes(!) and the rest of the album is pretty much a precursor to their next album, the legendary and absolutely classic \\&quot;Beneath the Remains\\&quot;.\n\nThis rip is 320 kbps and, as with the Anthrax one, got from the CD. In this case the 1997 remasters with \\&quot;Troops of Doom\\&quot;, \\&quot;The Past Reborns the Storms\\&quot; and some rough mixes for \\&quot;Septic Schizo\\&quot; and \\&quot;To The Wall\\&quot;.\n\nBUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE IT OR IT WILL REBORNS YOU!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f95595c6903019a807602d4632796a8f19c5afef","amp;dn":"METAL+CLASSIC%3A+Sepultura+Schizophrenia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f95595c6903019a807602d4632796a8f19c5afef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,85,149,198,144,48,25,168,7,96,45,70,50,121,106,143,25,197,175,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
