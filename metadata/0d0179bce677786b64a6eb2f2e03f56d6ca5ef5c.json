Now the reckoning!&quot; \nMILLANNO: a holiday planet of extreme wealth and extreme leisure - on one side. The other side of the planet teems with politicians, administrators, and also criminals. When the Professor and Ace decide to take a holiday, they are unwillingly pitched into a battle for supremacy on the planet. \n\nSeparated and suddenly finding themselves on the lost and lonely Isle of Prosperity, they must find each other. But standing in their way is the determination of a mysterious figure from the past to reclaim the Directorship of the planet. As the Professor and Ace explore, a picture begins to emerge of a corrupt past, of political double-dealing, betrayal and vengeance. \n\nWho is Milo, the psychokinetic youth who inhabits the island? Who is Gabriel, who sounds like a machine, but talks like a schoolmaster? And who is the earthy Calida, and why is she out for revenge? \n\nA dramatic meeting of old enemies can no longer be postponed, and there is no way off the island... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nthanks to original uploader on demonoid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d0179bce677786b64a6eb2f2e03f56d6ca5ef5c","amp;dn":"BBV03+-+Time+Travellers+-+Prosperity+Island+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d0179bce677786b64a6eb2f2e03f56d6ca5ef5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,1,121,188,230,119,120,107,100,166,235,47,46,3,245,109,108,165,239,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
