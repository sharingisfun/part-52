Drawn from heavy metal guitar, middle-eastern melodies, four-limbed drumming and a rollicking fat bass, the quartet rocks, swings, jams, and explodes. This is cathartic music, with a constant series of unpredictable climaxes and unending curves in musical direction. Fans of past Kiki band recordings will find plenty to love here.\n\nThe opening tune &quot;Squirrelly Dragon&quot; moves through a series of musical episodes with energy and brashness. It&amp;#039;s a great tune that draws you in and demands your attention with loudness, no matter what volume you have your player set at. The second tune, &quot;Monkey Mash,&quot; takes off with a nimble guitar line and wide-open sax playing, which converge and depart and flee into interesting spaces. Drummer Trump gets in some full-on rock-style drumming in here and everyone blasts away at their chosen instruments without restraint. \n\n&quot;The beginning was failed&quot; slows down for a bit, and everyone relaxes into a meditative piece that builds to anthem-like proportions. Its sparse lyricism and heartfelt minimal approach are like a beautiful break in the middle of the song list. Yet, the hanging on certain notes and care with delivery come out clearly.\n\n&quot;Viva Chuo-line Jazz&quot; picks the pace back up for a full-on blast of the energy that pours out of Chuo line clubs nightly. Everyone&amp;#039;s clearly into this tune and the pace hardly slows for a breath. &quot;Dowser&quot; gives moment of reprieve, before &quot;A fort of Zanzibal&quot; takes on a swirling Mediterranean melody by Umezu to close out the CD.\n\nThere may be no brand-new directions from the Kiki band here compared to past CDs, but there doesn&amp;#039;t need to be. It&amp;#039;s more of a very, very good thing.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jazzinjapan.com/cdr_kazutokiumezukikiband_dowser.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jazzinjapan.com/cdr_kazutokiumezukikiband_dowser.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89da88f485eca5174d06a738539e59d4bd0d78a2","amp;dn":"Kazutoki+Umezu+KIKI+Band+-+2005+-+Dowser+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89da88f485eca5174d06a738539e59d4bd0d78a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,218,136,244,133,236,165,23,77,6,167,56,83,158,89,212,189,13,120,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
