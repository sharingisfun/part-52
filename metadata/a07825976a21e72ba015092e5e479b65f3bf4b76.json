I included Will Vinton&amp;#039;s Comedy Of Horrors, a Will Vinton Claymation production. Although maybe not as entertaining as Ward 13 (Part 1) and a bit overstocked on standard jokes, Will Vinton made a lot of claymation shorts and received a lot of recognition for them. However, he lost control of his studio in 2002 after Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, bought up the company and fired him. Former CEO&amp;#039;s have a tendency of buying animation studio&amp;#039;s: Steve Jobs bought Pixar in 1986, which back then primarily sold it&amp;#039;s image computer power to the governments. Most of you have seen Luxo Jr, the short about a lamp and the reason the jumping lamp is still in the Pixar name: but maybe not many people have seen Luxo JR star in a Sesame Street short teaching young ones what is light, and what is heavy. Disney bought Pixar in 1991, and it&amp;#039;s possibly the best move they made for the future succes of Disney animation. Their own stuff, as their oscar nominated Little Match Girl, just doesn&amp;#039;t impress that much. Nowadays, more studio&amp;#039;s try to follow in Pixar&amp;#039;s footsteps: most notably, Blur Studio&amp;#039;s, who have made what might be their best animation to date: a Gentleman&amp;#039;s Duel. I don&amp;#039;t know who came up with the Mech-warrior association to place fighting machines in this setting, but it&amp;#039;s just perfect. Talking about weird associations: Priit Parn place this association game very well in Time Out, with a relaxed reggae tune on the background. One of the best shorts in this set is probably Strange Invaders, by Cordell Barker. Beautiful colors, great funny characters, perfect soundtrack. Piet Kroon deliviers a atmospheric animation with a strong classic storyline about a love triangle in 8 scenes, all animated by different animators (you might recognize Michael Dudok de Wit&amp;#039;s drawing style on the boat. Satiemanie, by Zdenko Gasparovich was made in 1978 from a huge number of drawings, starts with walking studies, the a large number of woman studies, and jumps to a more cartoonesque part. I also included Peter and the Wolf, which very deservingly got nominated for an Oscar (but I&amp;#039;m guessing it&amp;#039;s too early in Susan Templeton&amp;#039;s career to win). I also included the making of, because some people requested it. As promised, the Tale of Tales (Nohrstein&amp;#039;s best work) is featured in this edition as well. Enjoy, and please seed this torrent. Thanks for all of you who are keeping these torrents alive for almost 2 years now.\n\n\nPrevious Festival Editions:\n\nPart 1:\n\nContents of download:\n\n    * Folder icon Beltesassar&amp;#039;s Short Animation Festival\n          o  25 Ways To Quit Smoking (1989) Bill Plympton.avi (25 megabyte)\n          o  Au Bout Du Monde - Konstantin Bronzit (1998).avi (101.59 megabyte)\n          o  Balance - Lauenstein (1989).avi (49.33 megabyte)\n          o  Birthday.Boy.2004.avi (98.96 megabyte)\n          o  Blackfly - Christopher Hinton (1991) - .avi (56.9 megabyte)\n          o  Bunny - Blue Sky Chris Wedge (1998) Oscar Short Animated Film 1997.avi (93.04 megabyte)\n          o  Cowboys.(Phil.Mulloy,1991).avi (170 megabyte)\n          o  Crac - Frederic Back (1980).avi (137.5 megabyte)\n          o  Father and Daughter - Oscar Short Animated Film 2000 8&amp;#039;08.avi (36.75 megabyte)\n          o  Gopher Broke - Blur Studio Jeff Fowler (2004).avi (165.23 megabyte)\n          o  Harvie Krumpet (2003).avi (186.29 megabyte)\n          o  Intolerance &amp; Intolerance II - Phil Mulloy (2000 &amp; 2001).avi (242 megabyte)\n          o  Mike&amp;#039;s New Car - Pixar.avi (59.47 megabyte)\n          o  More - Mark Osborne (1998).avi (177.79 megabyte)\n          o  Pixar - Ice Age Extra(Gone Nutty).avi (40.89 megabyte)\n          o  Rejected - Don Hertzfeldt - 2000.avi (98.44 megabyte)\n          o  Rocks.Das.Rad.Germany-pp.avi (62.74 megabyte)\n          o  Special Delivery - John Weldon &amp; Eunice Macaulay (1978).avi (75.12 megabyte)\n          o  Strange Invaders.-.2004.avi (66.31 megabyte)\n          o  Tango - Zbigniew Rybczynski (1982).avi (42.69 megabyte)\n          o  The Big Snit - Richard Condie (1985).avi (78.49 megabyte)\n          o  The Fly - Oscar Short Animated Film 1980 3&amp;#039;00.avi (18.98 megabyte)\n          o  The Old Lady And The Pigeons - Sylvain Chomet (1998).avi (136.93 megabyte)\n          o  The Periwig-Maker - Schaffler (1999).avi (119.57 megabyte)\n          o  The Sandman - Paul Berry - (1991).avi (69.2 megabyte)\n          o  The.Cathedral.Poland-pp.avi (50.79 megabyte)\n          o  Vincent - Tim.Burton.avi (63.22 megabyte)\n          o  Ward 13 (2003).avi (190.28 megabyte)\n\nPart 2:\n\nContents of download:\n\n    * Folder icon Beltesassar&amp;#039;s Short Animation Festival Part 2\n          o  Alison Snowden &amp; David Fine (1987) - George and Rosemary.avi (96.62 megabyte)\n          o  Arkelope - Roslyn Schwartz (1994).mpg (51.57 megabyte)\n          o  Calypso is like so - Bruno Collet (2003).avi (103.45 megabyte)\n          o  Chris Landreth - Bingo The Clown (1998).avi (33.47 megabyte)\n          o  Fedorenco and Lamb - Every Child (1979).avi (61.26 megabyte)\n          o  Grasshoppers - Bruno Bozzetto (1990).avi (48.91 megabyte)\n          o  Konstantin Bronzit - Switchcraft (1994).avi (34 megabyte)\n          o  Luxo Jr - Pixar (1986).avi (33.09 megabyte)\n          o  Sex &amp; Violence - Bill Plympton.avi (42.95 megabyte)\n          o  The Metamorphosis of Mr. Samsa - Caroline Leaf (1977).avi (79.37 megabyte)\n          o  Voyage To Next - Faith &amp; John Hubley (1974).avi (147.51 megabyte)\n\n\nPart 3:\n\nContents of download:\n\n    * Folder icon Beltesassar&amp;#039;s Short Animation Festival Part 3\n          o  Bill Plympton - The fan and the flower (2005) - Narrated by Paul Giamatti.avi (83.77 megabyte)\n          o  Fallen Art (Tomek Baginski, 2004).avi (142.61 megabyte)\n          o  Ferenc Cak? - Stones (2000).avi (102.35 megabyte)\n          o  Flatlife - Jonas Geirnaert (2004).avi (73.33 megabyte)\n          o  Georges Schwizgebel - Les Jeune Fille Et Les Nuages (2000).avi (52.9 megabyte)\n          o  Matt Abbiss - Play (2003).avi (12.5 megabyte)\n          o  Norman McLaren - Lines Horizontal (1962).avi (100.05 megabyte)\n          o  Raoul Servais - Siren (1968).avi (110 megabyte)\n          o  Sven Martin - Ritterschlag (2003).avi (50.03 megabyte)\n          o  The Chain - Phill Mulloy (1997).avi (97.08 megabyte)\n\nPart 4:\n\nBeltesassar&amp;#039;s Short Animation Festival Part 4\n\n    *  Blur Studio - In The Rough (2004).avi (230.62 megabyte)\n    *  Bruno Bozzetto - Baeus (1987).avi (80.11 megabyte)\n    *  Genre - Don Hertzfeldt (1996).avi (19.56 megabyte)\n    *  Joanna Quinn (1996) - Famous Fred.avi (298.99 megabyte)\n    *  Peter Lord (1996) - Wat&amp;#039;S Pig.avi (122.93 megabyte)\n    *  Pjotr Sapegin - Huset Pa Kampen (1998).avi (49.08 megabyte)\n    *  Ring Of Fire - Andreas Hykade (2000).avi (230.96 megabyte)\n    *  The Mermaid - Aleksandr Petrov (1997).avi (120.6 megabyte)\n    *  The Monk and the Fish - Dudok de Wit (1994).avi (89.35 megabyte)\n\nPart 5:\n\nThis time, I have been especially good to you. These 25 animations contain some very recent animations (e.g. three short animations nominated for and Oscar, namely 9, Badgered and check out the should have been winner the Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello) some young and upcoming stars from the Badenburg Acedemie (Annie &amp; Boo and Wunderwerk), some funny stop motion (Wallace and Grommit, Angry Kid) and some sad (Dog by Templeton) and I added a selection of the best animators or the last 50 years (Norman McLaren, Phill Mulloy, Bill Plympton, Richard Condie, Wendy Tilby). Alltogether it&amp;#039;s over 3 hours worth of material. It will take a while to download, but trust me: it&amp;#039;s worth it.\n\nBeltesassar&amp;#039;s Short Animation Festival Part 5\n\n    *  9 - Shane Acker (2005).avi (90.92 megabyte)\n    *  A Grand Day Out - Wallace &amp; Grommit 1991.avi (181.86 megabyte)\n    *  Angry Kid - Peter Lord.avi (23.09 megabyte)\n    *  Annie and Boo (2004) Johannes Weilund.avi (251.42 megabyte)\n    *  Badgered (2005) Sharon Colman.avi (38.39 megabyte)\n    *  Bill Plympton - The Exciting Life Of A Tree.avi (47.21 megabyte)\n    *  Bob&amp;#039;s Birthday - Allison Snowden &amp; David Fine.avi (102.7 megabyte)\n    *  Charade - Minnis - 1984.avi (13.13 megabyte)\n    *  Chris Landreth - Ryan (2004).avi (149.84 megabyte)\n    *  Konstantin Bronzit (2003) - The God.avi (33.03 megabyte)\n    *  La Linea 145 (Cavandoli).avi (22.54 megabyte)\n    *  Michael Sieber - Wunderwerk (2002).avi (80.11 megabyte)\n    *  Norman McLaren - Neighbours (1952).avi (126.83 megabyte)\n    *  Pedro Serrazina - Tale About the Cat and the Moon (1995).avi (55.39 megabyte)\n    *  Raoul Servais - Chromophobia (1966).avi (109.33 megabyte)\n    *  Richard Condie - The Apprentice (1991).avi (85.5 megabyte)\n    *  Ring - Anna and Bella - 1984.avi (35.03 megabyte)\n    *  Ryan Larkin - Syrinx (1965).avi (22.03 megabyte)\n    *  Suzie Templeton - Dog.avi (16.42 megabyte)\n    *  The History of the World - Phil Mulloy (1994).avi (54.73 megabyte)\n    *  The Man With The Beautiful Eyes - (Charles Bukowski).avi (102.24 megabyte)\n    *  The Mysterious Geographic Explorations Of Jasper Morello Pdtv Xvid.avi (175.05 megabyte)\n    *  The.End.of.the.World.in.Four.Seasons - Paul van Driessen.avi (278.19 megabyte)\n    *  Tim Webb - A Is For Autism (1992).avi (99.17 megabyte)\n    *  Wendy Tilby (1991) - Strings.avi (116.4 megabyte)\n\nPart 6:\n\nI am spoiling you, I realise, but here is anotherpart of my animation short film festival. This time I have some funnyshort for you (Cousin, The Chubbchubbs, Do It yourself Cartoon Kit,Poumse), some more serious animations (Le Chapeau, Pad, Illusion) andsome simply weird ones but great to watch (Cat Soup &amp; Karl &amp; Marilyn). Hope you enjoy them. Also check out parts 1-5 if you haven&amp;#039;t already.\n\nBeltesassar&amp;#039;s Short Animation Festival Part 6\n\n    *  Adam Elliot - Cousin.mpg (44.82 megabyte)\n    *  Bob Godrey - Do It Yourself Cartoon Kit (1961).avi (48.62 megabyte)\n    *  Frederic Back - Illusion (1975).avi (181.96 megabyte)\n    *  Guard Dog - Bill Plympton (2004).avi (60.32 megabyte)\n    *  Ishu Patel (1977) - The Bead Game.avi (63.88 megabyte)\n    *  Mich?le Cournoyer (1999) - Le Chapeau (The Hat).avi (66.37 megabyte)\n    *  Pad - Aurel Klimt 1999.avi (67.06 megabyte)\n    *  Pixar - The Chubbchubbs.mpg (97.5 megabyte)\n    *  Poumse (1990) Mikhail Aldashin.avi (48.03 megabyte)\n    *  Priit P?rn - 2003 - Karl Ja Marilyn.avi (349.07 megabyte)\n    *  Tatsuo Sato - Nekojiru-so (Cat Soup) - 2001.avi (379.24 megabyte)\n\n\nPart 7:\n\nFor Part 7, I decided to select some old unknown animations, and somenew unknown anmations. I included one of the oldest animations ever byWinston McCay from 1911, a silly symphonies from 1934 and the excellentThree Blind Mice by Dunning (who would later direct Yellow Submarine).Besides these, there are some animations I personally like fromstudents or small production companies. Rosto A.D. is an impressivegroup (check their website) Le Building is probably the best shortunder 2 minutes I have ever seen, and Inventaire Fantome reminds me alot of Jasper Morello I included in Part 5 (sorry for those who don&amp;#039;tspeak french, but I think you will still enjoy it). I added some betterknown animators for those who don&amp;#039;t like the less known stuff, likeAlkabetz, Bozzetto, the lesser known Killing an Egg (which isn&amp;#039;t evenmentioned on IMDB) by Driessen (who actually worked as an animator onthe Yellow Submarine as well, but anyway), Aldeshin and Brakhage. Jojo in the Stars is a very atmospheric animaton which I like a lot as well.Hope you enjoy this selection. My hard drive (40 GB) is being taken upby all these animations (over 10 GB); most likely I will put up one more part and then stop for a while.

I included more mainstream animations like A Greek Tragedy, Self Service, When The Day Breaks, and Bill Plymbton&amp;#039;s Push comes to Shove. There are 3 longer animations, Daniel Greaves&amp;#039; Flatworld, The Cunning Little Vixen (a nice BBC production) and Zbrodnia i Kara (Crime and Punishment) by Dumala. There are more eastern European animators in this torrent, the unknown Gary Seko and Michaela Pavlatova. From Japan comes the godfather of manga, Osamu Tezuka with his nice short Jumping. Alltogether I hope you will like the collection, and I hope I could interest some more people in short animated films.\n\n    *    78 Tours (Georges Schwizgebel, 1985).avi\tVideo\t31.13 M\n    *    Amanda Forbis, Wendy Tilby - When the Day Breaks (1999).mpg\tVideo\t94.43 M\n    *    Aubier &amp; Patar - Babyroussa, the Babiroussa.avi\tVideo\t86.02 M\n    *    Bill Plympton - Push Comes To Shove (1991).avi\tVideo\t155.98 M\n    *    Brad Caslor &amp; Christopher Hinton - Blowhard.mpg\tVideo\t92.72 M\n    *    Bruno Bozzetto - Self Service.avi\tVideo\t92.29 M\n    *    Christmas (1996) Mikhail Aldashin.avi\tVideo\t179.83 M\n    *    Daniel Greaves (1997) Flatworld.avi\tVideo\t311.62 M\n    *    Disney - 1953 - Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom.mpg\tVideo\t102.92 M\n    *    Don Hertzfeldt - Intermission.avi\tVideo\t35.18 M\n    *    Evelyn Lambart (1974) Mr. Frog Went A-Courting.mpg\tVideo\t43.9 M\n    *    Garik Seko (1982) Ex Libris.avi\tVideo\t93.87 M\n    *    John Halas (1963) Automania 2000.avi\tVideo\t77.88 M\n    *    Jolly Roger - Mark Baker (1998).avi\tVideo\t68.38 M\n    *    Osamu Tezuka (1984) Jumping.avi\tVideo\t25.27 M\n    *    Piotr Dumala - Zbrodnia i Kara (2000).avi\tVideo\t354.78 M\n    *    Quest - Tyron Montgomery &amp; Thomas Stellmach (1996).asf\tVideo\t24.44 M\n    *    Repeat (1995) Pavlatova.avi\tVideo\t123.94 M\n    *    Suzan Pitt (1973) - Jefferson Circus Songs.avi\tVideo\t95.25 M\n    *    The Cunning Little Vixen (2003) Geoff Dunbar.avi\tVideo\t400.02 M\n    *    Van Goethem (1986) A Greek Tragedy.avi\tVideo\t32.45 M\n    *    Winsor McCay - 1912 - How A Mosquito Operates.avi\tVideo\t38.18 M\n\nPart 9\n\nAfter almost one year, I have decided to celebrate the first year aniversary of Beltesassar&amp;#039;s Short Animation Festival with a new torrent. After putting out 8 torrents with approximately 135 excellent animations, I received a lot of thank you&amp;#039;s from people who were very grateful they could finallt (once again) see some short animations the really wanted to see. For all the people that made requests for animations, I have made this torrent. It contains all the video&amp;#039;s I have which people requested for. Like L&amp;#039;Homme Sans Ombre by George Schwizgebel and Walking, by Ryan Larkin. Three currently Oscar nominated Short Animation are in here: Scrat (getting less and less funny), Little Matchgirl (Disney is getting more and more traditional) and Maestro, a funny short building up to one great joke: but I hope and think Torill Kove will win. \nI included some recent animations, for example Overtime, which has a very nice atmosphere and which I found was quite enjoyable - it won the OIAF award for best graduate film, and The Cags, by Alexei Petrov (Note this is not Aleksandr Petrov, whose Old Man and the Sea I might add to part 10). I added 2 movies from the Arnaud Demuynck production house, Signes de Vie, a dark and sad animation with a hapy ending, made by Arnaud Demuynck, and Chahut, made by Gilles Cuvelier. I also added Vent by Erik van Schaaik, because he&amp;#039;s dutch just like me and the movie is doing really well on international festivals. Humdrum by Peter Peake was nominated for an Oscar, as was Quest. But let&amp;#039;s be honest, the folks at the Oscar really don&amp;#039;t have a clue about what&amp;#039;s worthwhile in short animation: there are a lot better recent animations that never got nominated to begin with. Morir de Amor for example, or Rabbit by Run Wrake. Or how about the lovely animated romantic comedy in 9 mnutes A Backbone Tale by Jeremy Clapin? I also added a video clip: one of the few places in popular culture animation still has a prominent place, and have chosen for Good Song by Blur, animated by Snynola, for which they got the McLaren animation award in 2004. I added some unknown animators who made nice animations, and finally, I included some better known animators: Paul van Driessen, Michael Dudok de Wit, Suzan Pitt and Don Hertzfeldt, which I&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;ll like, but who are slightly overclassed by younger artists in this torrent, I have to admit.
