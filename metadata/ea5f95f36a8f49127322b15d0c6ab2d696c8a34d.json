The results include ZZ Top-style boogie and blues-rock (&quot;Boogie Queen&quot;), pre-Ted Nugent Gonzo guitar heroisms (&quot;Witness to the Truth&quot;), both of these at once (&quot;Tickelick&quot;), or neither, when it comes to the anthemic southern rock of &quot;My Last Goodbye&quot; and semi-hit single &quot;Louisiana Cock Fight.&quot; In addition, several cuts (&quot;No Sun,&quot; &quot;The Nature of Your Taste,&quot; etc.) see the trio augmented with soulful back-up singers for a Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen sort of vibe, while others still see the versatile trio flirting with country rock (&quot;L.A. Texas Boy &quot;) and plaintive balladry (the piano-enhanced &quot;Enigma&quot;). Yet, the album&amp;#039;s most intriguing/unique quality may be how the deceptively simple, universal, off the cuff material described above features obvious, if nuanced, sophistication, and is offset by lyrically weighty, post-flower-power fare as seen in the aforementioned &quot;No Sun&quot; and &quot;Hero of the War.&quot; And the fact that even these would-be progressive tendencies are kept to concise song lengths is what probably spared this album from utterly fatal dating; by extension, further separating Nitzinger&amp;#039;s raised-on-the-jukebox-singles wheat, from the era&amp;#039;s dominant music-conservatory-on-mushrooms chaff -- if you know what we mean. Originally presented in a deluxe gatefold sleeve, it&amp;#039;s not surprising that the Nitzinger LP has long been coveted by ÃƒÂ¢??70s rock collectors for the band&amp;#039;s one-of-a-kind mixture of earthy grit and fearless (possibly naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve) flights of fancy.
