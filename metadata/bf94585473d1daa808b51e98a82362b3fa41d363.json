These great albums are  quite hard to come by, so grab them while they&amp;#039;re hot, and please seed for a while after you finish downloading. :) And as always, if you really dig the music and are able to buy them from somewhere, please do it. However, I think all copies are sold out for now . The torrent includes the following albums:\n\n\nPresence of Mind [2000] (320k)\nOmega [2004] (192k)\n\n\nEnjoy!
