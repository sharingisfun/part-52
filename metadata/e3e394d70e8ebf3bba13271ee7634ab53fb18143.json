In your hard drive space, you can establish and access up to 23 different virtual CD/DVD-ROM drives. It works by creating image files of the CD/DVD-ROM \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s content on your hard drive. It can also run programs much faster than they would if they were running off a conventional CD/DVD-ROM drive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e394d70e8ebf3bba13271ee7634ab53fb18143","amp;dn":"CDSpace+4.1+%28100%25+Working%2C+Serial+Included%29+CD%2FDVD-ROM+EMULATOR.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e394d70e8ebf3bba13271ee7634ab53fb18143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,227,148,215,14,142,191,59,186,19,39,30,231,99,74,181,63,177,129,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
