Faint\n\nShow Notes:\n- Members of the U.C.L.A. marching band played a brief intro to No More Sorrow before the show, and joined LP onstage later for the drum solo and ending of Bleed It Out.\n- Bloc Party was over Points Of Authority.\n- My December was performed for the first time since Sendai, JP 2006.08.15, and the piano part was completely different from the original song.\n- Mike briefly played the melody to &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; on piano before Breaking the Habit.\n- Hands Held High was played after the encore break and had an extended organ intro, and a children&amp;#039;s choir joined the band to sing the chorus.\n- Bleed it Out had a brief new guitar intro.\n- The children&amp;#039;s choir sang part of &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot; over the intro to Hands Held High, but it was REALLY low in the mix during the webcast, to the point that it could barely be heard.\n\n\nGet the audio only right here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hahninator.sotrix.net/linkinlive/kroqaac/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hahninator.sotrix.net/linkinlive/kroqaac/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29ff422b3b89049417b8b662118f3b61a39582a","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+KROQ+Almost+Acoustic+Christmas+2007-12-04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29ff422b3b89049417b8b662118f3b61a39582a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,159,244,34,179,184,144,73,65,123,139,102,33,24,243,182,26,57,88,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
