First one is at network level, all incoming and outgoing packets are watched. Second one is at application level, all application trying to connect to internet are watched.\n\nFor Internet filtering, a configurable ruleset allows you to define the authorized packets and the packets you\\&amp;#039;d like to block. A default ruleset is provided with Look \\&amp;#039;n\\&amp;#039; Stop. This default ruleset suits for a standard Internet use. This level of filtering is controlled through the \\&amp;#039;Internet Filtering\\&amp;#039; page.\n\nFor application filtering, Look \\&amp;#039;n\\&amp;#039; Stop maintains a list of applications authorized to connect to Internet. Every time a new unknown application tries to connect, a popup dialog box alerts you. Then you decide to allow or not this new application to connect. This level of filtering is controlled through the \\&amp;#039;Application Filtering\\&amp;#039; page.\n\nThe \\&amp;#039;Log\\&amp;#039; page maintains the history of events that occurred. An event is either a blocked packet or a blocked application. You can select what you want to see in the log by configuring the Internet Filtering and the Application Filtering.\n\nFinally, the \\&amp;#039;Options\\&amp;#039; let you to configure Look \\&amp;#039;n\\&amp;#039; Stop according to your preferences.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.looknstop.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.looknstop.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6cea8d7c1a5c9cc204e720b45b7768537b43d19","amp;dn":"LooknStop206%2Bkeygen.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6cea8d7c1a5c9cc204e720b45b7768537b43d19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,206,168,215,193,165,201,204,32,78,114,11,69,183,118,133,55,180,61,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
