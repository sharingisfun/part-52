The OEM&amp;#039;s hardware-embedded BIOS ACPI_SLIC information signed by Microsoft.\n\n2. A certificate issued by Microsoft that corresponds to the specific ACPI_SLIC information.\n\n   The certificate is an XML file found on the OEM&amp;#039;s installation/recovery media,\n   ususally called something like &amp;#039;oemname.xrm-ms&amp;#039;.\n\n3. A special type of product key that corresponds to the installed edition of Windows Vista.\n\n   This key can usually be obtained from some installation script found on the OEM&amp;#039;s\n   installation/recovery media or directly from a pre-installed OEM system.\n\nIf all three elements match Windows Vista&amp;#039;s licensing mechansim considers the given\ninstallation a valid system-locked pre-activated copy (that does not require any\nadditional product activation procedures).\n\nSo the basic concept of the tool at hand is to present any given BIOS ACPI_SLIC information to Windows\nVista&amp;#039;s licensing mechanism by means of a device driver.\nIn combination with a matching product key and OEM certificate this allows for rendering any system\npractically indistinguishable from a legit pre-activated system shipped by the respective OEM.\n\n\nHow do I use it?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPreliminary hint:\nMost operations described below require elevated privileges, so disabling UAC (Run-&gt;MSCONFIG.EXE-&gt;\nTools-&gt;Disable UAC) for the time being is recommended, Of course, it can be safely re-enabled after\nall steps have been performed. Otherwise OEMTOOL.EXE and some SLMGR.VBS operations must be explicitly\nrun with adminstrative privileges.\n\n1. Install the Windows Vista x86 edition of your choice without entering any product key during setup.\n   Basically any Windows Vista x86 installation media will do, regardless if it&amp;#039;s MSDN/Retail/OEM/...,\n   MSDN/Retail are recommended though.\n\n2. Install the emulation driver.\n\n   Run OEMTOOL.EXE, select the OEM BIOS information to emulate (ASUS might be a good choice given the\n   fact that it&amp;#039;s the only OEM for which a complete set of product keys is provided ;)) and hit the\n   &amp;#039;&lt;Install Emulation Driver&gt;&amp;#039; button.\n\n   Alternatively you can just right-click the ROYAL.INF file and chose &amp;#039;Install&amp;#039; from the appearing\n   menu. This only allows for installing the default OEM BIOS information (ASUS) though and is strongly\n   discouraged unless OEMTOOL.EXE fails for some unknown reason.\n\n   When prompted about whether to install an unsigned driver, allow it.\n   (For some odd reason Microsoft didn&amp;#039;t wanna sign this one...;))\n\n3. Reboot your machine.\n\n4. Install the OEM certificate matching your OEM selection during driver installation by running\n\n   SLMGR.VBS -ilc &lt;OEMNAME&gt;.XRM-MS\n\n   (e.g. &quot;SLMGR.VBS -ilc C:\\ASUS.XRM-MS&quot; if you chose to install the default driver and extracted\n    the certificate file to C:\\)\n\n   Note that this operation might take quite a while depending on your system, so be patient.\n\n5. Install an OEM product key matching the installed edition of Windows Vista x86 by running\n\n   SLMGR.VBS -ipk &lt;OEM_PRODUCT_KEY&gt;\n\n   (e.g. &quot;SLMGR.VBS -ipk 6F2D7-2PCG6-YQQTB-FWK9V-932CC&quot; if you&amp;#039;re running Windows Vista Ultimate using\n    the default emulation driver)\n\n   Note that this operation might take quite a while depending on your system, so be patient.\n\n   See PKEYS.TXT for a list of OEM product keys published by different OEMs.\n\n6. Run &amp;#039;SLMGR.VBS -dlv&amp;#039; or right-click &amp;#039;Computer&amp;#039; and chose &amp;#039;Properties&amp;#039; to verify your licensing status.\n\nDue to the variety of possible combinations of different earlier Vista activation hacks we&amp;#039;re not gonna\nprovide details on &amp;#039;persuading&amp;#039; existing installations to accept this method.\nDuring our test the general procedure depicted above worked out fine though, i.e. installing the emulation\ndriver, rebooting the machine and then using the officially documented ways of installing a matching OEM\ncertificate and product key should do the trick in all but the most messed up cases.\n\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s that &amp;#039;&lt;Dump OEM BIOS Information&gt;&amp;#039; button in OEMTOOL.EXE for?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt dumps the BIOS ACPI_SLIC information of any SLP 2.0-enabled OEM system.\nThe dump can consecutively be used to emulate (&amp;#039;clone&amp;#039;) that information on any other system by specifying\nthe &amp;#039;Custom&amp;#039; option.\nUsing this function on a system booted using the emulation driver will give a dump identical to the currently\nemulated OEM BIOS information, so be sure to uninstall the driver and reboot the source machine first if you\nintend to dump the actual hardware-embedded OEM BIOS data.\n\n\nWhat are all those files for?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDIFXAPI.DLL\t\t\t- a runtime dll for Microsoft&amp;#039;s DIFx API used by oemtool.exe\nOEMTOOL.EXE\t\t\t- an application for installing/uninstalling the emulation driver\n\t\t\t  \t  and dumping BIOS ACPI_SLIC information from any SLP 2.0-enabled\n\t\t\t  \t  Windows Vista OEM system\nPKEYS.TXT\t\t\t- contains a list of validated OEM product keys\nREADME.TXT\t\t\t- this file\nROYAL.INF\t\t\t- driver .INF file, can be (ab)used to install the emulation driver\n\t\t\t  \t  in case oemtool.exe fails to perform this task\nROYAL.SYS\t\t\t- the emulation device driver\n\nCERTS\\ACER.XRM-MS\t\t- the certificate that corresponds to the ACPI_SLIC information\n\t\t\t  \t  emulated by the driver when &amp;#039;Acer&amp;#039; has been selected during\n\t\t\t  \t  driver installation\nCERTS\\ASUS.XRM-MS\t\t- the certificate that corresponds to the ACPI_SLIC information\n\t\t\t  \t  emulated by the driver when &amp;#039;ASUS&amp;#039; has been selected during\n\t\t\t  \t  driver installation\nCERTS\\HEWLETT-PACKARD.XRM-MS\t- the certificate that corresponds to the ACPI_SLIC information\n\t\t\t  \t  emulated by the driver when &amp;#039;Hewlett-Packard&amp;#039; has been selected\n\t\t\t  \t  during driver installation\nCERTS\\LENOVO.XRM-MS\t\t- the certificate that corresponds to the ACPI_SLIC information\n\t\t\t  \t  emulated by the driver when &amp;#039;Lenovo&amp;#039; has been selected during\n\t\t\t  \t  driver installation\n\n\n\nEnjoy,\nTEAM PARADOX &amp;#039;07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee0ae7213b77826972a85e40e8cb95d29186ae4c","amp;dn":"Paradox+Vista+activator+%2B+WGA+crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee0ae7213b77826972a85e40e8cb95d29186ae4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,10,231,33,59,119,130,105,114,168,94,64,232,203,149,210,145,134,174,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
