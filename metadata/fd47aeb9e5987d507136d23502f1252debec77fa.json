Can&amp;#039;t say that 12.31.06 will earn them a medal for tightness but hey, we were all there to have fun, and let&amp;#039;s just say that everyone passed. If you were in attendance, then this recording&amp;#039;s definitely for you. \n- Debut of &amp;#039;Jungle Love&amp;#039; cover originally by Morris Day &amp; The Time. \n- The guy leading the drunken &amp;#039;God Bless America&amp;#039; sing-a-long was a local character whose name sounds like &quot;Rainbow Young&quot; as far as I can tell from the recording, but never attempted to confirm with Zee. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd47aeb9e5987d507136d23502f1252debec77fa","amp;dn":"Ryan+Montbleau+nye+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd47aeb9e5987d507136d23502f1252debec77fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,71,174,185,229,152,125,80,113,54,210,53,2,241,37,45,235,236,119,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
