The F-14 Tomcat has been a labor of love for Stephen and the model shows this, from the authentic and highly detailed exterior to the in depth virtual cockpit, this model truly shines above all other IRIS products. \n\nIt?s not only the modeling which has taken a leap forward in this product, but we have had the honour of being provided with textures from Dag Roger Stangeland and Jens-Ole Kjoelberg, both well known and established artists. \n\nHowever the real treat for Tomcat fans in this aircraft is not just the cosmetic details, but also the inner workings of the product. Utilizing XML code in the 3DS Max model and having the talents of Rob Barendregt on board, we have been able to provide you with what has been popularly deemed as the first successful modeling of a switchable wingsweep system. The wingsweep system in this F-14 can be selected by the user to work in automatic or manual mode with separate control of the flaps. \n\nAs usual, the Tomcat features a plethora of loadouts, textures and animations such as exits, boarding ladders, intake ramps, exhaust nozzles, flaps, slats, spoilers and more. Also included are a great number of effects, which are sure to please the eye. \n\nWe have also once again had the privilege to employ the sound genius of Christoffer Petersen who has provided us with some excellent sounds for the Tomcat which I am sure will have you playing with that volume control! \n\nBelow is a brief summary of the product and be sure to visit the screenshots forum to view our latest images of this magnificent aircraft. \n\nPrior to downloading, please ensure your firewalls and download managers are disabled as these interfere with the PHP script used to retrieve your file. \n\n\n\n\n- Backlit canopy gauges for accuate night-time flying \n- Interactive Virtual Cockpit including over 40 interactive objects. \n- GMax programmed XML parts such as correctly modelled wingsweep, drooping elevators on engine shutdown, correctly automated intake splitter plates and more. \n- Custom Soundpack designed by Christoffer Petersen made from actual recordings of the F-14 Tomcat. \n- Loads of custom animations for the F-14, including working tailhook, control surfaces, canopy, speedbrakes, boarding ladder and much much more. \n- Enhanced flight dynamics complete with full loadout details for user control of multiple configurations. \n- A total of twenty-one superb quality external models featuring different loadouts for the most commonly used US Navy F-14 Tomcat. \n- Eleven detailed textures for the F-14 Tomcat from the US Navy to the Islamic Republic of Iran, the last operator of the F-14A Tomcat. \n- Value for money, over 30 custom combinations of the F-14A to pick from and fly, all created in stunning detail. \n- Full effects suite consisting of specially designed afterburner effects, wingtip vorticies, upper wing shockwave effect and more... \n- Full paintkit in PSD format for use in Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro for repainters to use, complete with weathering, backgrounds and panel lines all predrawn for easy repaints!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c61a6c9e109ceadfa0374f19d378b8ca7cca79","amp;dn":"IRIS+Flight+Simulation+Software+-+F-14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c61a6c9e109ceadfa0374f19d378b8ca7cca79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,198,26,108,158,16,156,234,223,160,55,79,25,211,120,184,202,124,202,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
