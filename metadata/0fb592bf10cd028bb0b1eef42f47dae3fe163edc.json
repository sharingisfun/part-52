Only \nnow, with the gaming power made possible by the Playstation is a world as \nvast and detailed as King&amp;#039;s Field a reality.  This first-person game is \ncompletely rendered in beautiful 3D polygon graphics, with texture mapping \nand fully controllable 360 degree viewing.\n\nImagine a universe where you can travel freely - being able to look up and \ndown, climb ancient ruins, traverse across oceans, jump off ridges, and duel \nenemies - all in real time non-linear play.  This visual world will not only \nastound you, but pull you right into its universe.  You will embark on a \njourney to an island of evil-ridden dungeons, villages, and castles as you \nseek the Moonlight Sword, which had been stolen by a cult of insidious \nworshippers of evil.\n\nAnd now your journey begins...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fb592bf10cd028bb0b1eef42f47dae3fe163edc","amp;dn":"psx_kings+field.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fb592bf10cd028bb0b1eef42f47dae3fe163edc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,181,146,191,16,205,2,139,176,177,238,244,47,71,218,227,254,22,62,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
