Mature, tough, tight groovy  \nmusic with edge and energy. No cheese, just        \ndirect, effective, modern day Psy electronica.    \nDesert Sun kicks off the album with a funky Psy    \nElectro groove. Showing what talent Hujaboy has    \nin trying his hand at the more contemporary        \nminimal sounds around at the moment. He has        \nobviously been listening to Trentemoller and the  \nlikes...and pulled off a great upfront and        \nexperimental track to start the album off that is  \nstill psychedelic and maintains the force and      \npower that is a Hujaboy trademark. Holes in the    \nsky moves towards a more traditional Psytrance    \nsound, but with no unnecessary frills just clean,  \nfocused sounds and good beats, concentrating on    \nwhat rocks a dance floor without the fluff! This  \nin fact sets the tone for the rest of the album    \nwith Premium Delirium building on this with a      \nkick and bass that could knock you flat against a  \nwall! Acid revival retains the full frontal power  \nof Hujaboy but brings an element of acid house    \ninto the groove. The result is a crowd pleaser.    \nAlready one of the biggest tracks in his current  \nlive set. Throughout, elements of old skool        \nmelodies along with cool lines and sounds evolve  \nand are woven into a luscious groove. The title    \ntrack Black Belt roughens things up with tough    \npercussion that jumps out of the speakers. Sounds  \nlike it&amp;#039;s just in front of your face like the      \nback of Bruce Lee&amp;#039;s hand! Enter the Hujaboy!      \nClarity and precision are the name of the game in  \n&amp;#039;Black Belt&amp;#039;, no nonsense bass driven dance floor  \ndamaging Psytrance!
