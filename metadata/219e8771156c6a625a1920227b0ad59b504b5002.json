You change between the open files by clicking on their tabs. No hassle with heaps of overlapping windows.\n\nIf you want, EditPad Lite limits itself to one instance, saving you a lot of task switching, and keep an icon visible in the system tray, for quick access.Save time with the Search and replace that can work across all open files. Reduce frustration with the unlimited undo and redo, which can undo changes even after saving them.\nEditPad Lite is fully globalized. You can convert between ANSI, ASCII and Unicode (UCS-2 and UTF-8), and work with Unix and Mac files. Create text files in any language you like, whether thatÃ‚Â´s English, French, Russian or Chinese). EditPad Lite itself has also been translated into many languages, including all documentation.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:219e8771156c6a625a1920227b0ad59b504b5002","amp;dn":"EditPad+Lite+6.3.1+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"219e8771156c6a625a1920227b0ad59b504b5002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,158,135,113,21,108,106,98,90,25,32,34,123,10,213,155,80,75,80,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
