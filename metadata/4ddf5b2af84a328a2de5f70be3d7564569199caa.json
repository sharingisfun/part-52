The Enemy Inside\n\nReview from Release Magazine:\nClassic in structure and mood, but highly modern in sound and production, &quot;Noob&quot; abandons the lingering experimental itch of recent albums. De/Vision have made a pop album high in intensity and tempo, full of glances to the past while maintaining a high profile contemporary framework.\nGiving more room for straight forward synthpop means having to produce stronger songs. A challenge song writer Steffen Keth answers by writing some of De/Vision&amp;#039;s best songs to date. The Depeche tribute &quot;What You Deserve&quot;, &quot;Life is Suffering&quot;, a synthetic paradox for the dance floor, the single &quot;Flavour of the Week&quot; and the epic &quot;Far Side of the Moon&quot; are all fantastic pop worthy of worldwide recognition. A few bores, like the drearily uninspired &quot;Nine Lives&quot; and &quot;Death of Me&quot;, can not take away from a great electropop disc.\n&quot;Noob&quot; is accomplished, catchy and full of the pop bliss associated with the earlier days of the band. Enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ddf5b2af84a328a2de5f70be3d7564569199caa","amp;dn":"De%2FVision+-+NOOB%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ddf5b2af84a328a2de5f70be3d7564569199caa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,223,91,42,248,74,50,138,45,229,247,11,227,215,86,69,105,25,156,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
