Smith finds himself embroiled in a complex political conspiracy once he aids a pregnant woman who is being chased by a hitman. He takes the baby and goes on the run with a prostitute (Monica Bellucci). The unlikely family is trailed by the intelligent and ruthless Hertz (played by Paul Giamatti) and his army of thugs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3055facd963b0235aaebe5db0197b0bc7cfb11eb","amp;dn":"Shoot.Em.Up.SWESUB.Xvid-maz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3055facd963b0235aaebe5db0197b0bc7cfb11eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,85,250,205,150,59,2,53,170,235,229,219,1,151,176,188,124,251,17,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
