Rating:  \t\n  3.4 / 5 (based on 4 ratings).\n\nPlot:\tWhen terrorists take over a luxury hotel, an ex-cop-turned-stuntman-and-bodyguard must protect a cowardly, prima-donna action star and rescue the hostages from a criminal mastermind who caused the death of his family years before.\n\nOverview:\tHigh Risk stars Jet Li as Kit (a.k.a. &quot;Bold&quot;), an army officer who fails to save his wife and child from being blown up by the criminal blackmailer &quot;Doctor.&quot; He now works as the bodyguard and secret stunt double for Frankie (Jacky Cheung), a Hong Kong superstar known for his martial arts and daring stuntwork. In truth, he&amp;#039;s a lecher and a drunk with deteriorating kung fu skills. An investigative reporter (Chingmy Yau) is onto him, so she finagles some tickets to a gala showing of the Russian Tsar&amp;#039;s crown jewels at a luxury high-rise in order to get the scoop on Frankie, who has also been invited. Also attending are a gang of proffesional bad guys, led by the nefarious Doctor, who are out to steal the jewels for themselves. As it happens, one of the villains, a long-haired killer named Bond, is obsessed with killing Frankie in combat. It&amp;#039;s up to Kit to beat the bad guys and rescue the hostages, and Frankie to live up to his image.\n\nCast: \tJet Li Lian-Jie  ||  Jacky Cheung Hok-Yau  ||  Chingmy Yau Suk-Ching  ||  Valerie Chow Kar-Ling  ||  Wu Ma  ||  Charlie Yeung Choi-Nei  ||  Wong Siu  ||  Lam Kwok-Bun  ||  Charlie Cho Cha-Lei  ||  Tuan Wai-Lun  ||  Billy Chow Bei-Lei \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
