In other\nwords, if John Q. Public walks into a voting both, sees the names\nof two people he knows nothing about, but RECOGNIZES one of them,\nthat&amp;#039;s who will win. And any moron should be able to see that that\nis precisely why the mainstream media is paying so little attention\nto Ron Paul: they don&amp;#039;t WANT people hearing about him.\n\n&quot;Freedom of the mind requires not only, or not even especially, the\nabsence of legal constraints but the presence of alternative\nthoughts. The most successful tyranny is not the one that uses\nforce to assure uniformity, but the one that removes awareness of\nother possibilities.&quot; (Alan Bloom)\n\nIf all the people ever hear about are the two faces (Democrat and\nRepublican) of the one ruling class of devout socialist/fascists,\nthey won&amp;#039;t even know that there IS something dramatically different\nthey could be supporting. (As a depressing example, during the\nThird Reich, many of those who opposed German fascism were\ncommunists, because that&amp;#039;s the only alternative they knew about.)\n\nYesterday, Ron Paul made campaigning history by raising six million\ndollars in one day. The media will probably mention it, but will\ncouch it in the constant message of &quot;but he still can&amp;#039;t possibly\nwin.&quot; Mr. Paul&amp;#039;s campaign is the best current example I can think\nof of tyrant propaganda tactics. It&amp;#039;s truly amazing to watch.\n\nWhile the self-annointed, aspiring tyrants of both parties are\nsupported by their rich buddies, Ron Paul is supported by lots and\nlots of mere &quot;peasants.&quot; So why does the media try so hard to\nignore him, and when they do mention him, why do the constantly\ndenigrate and insult him? For all hoopla the talking heads and\n&quot;reporters&quot; give about &quot;democracy,&quot; they don&amp;#039;t mean it. When a lot\nof the people really DO want something, as is obviously the case\nwith Ron Paul, the elitist media show their true disdain for the\ngeneral public. Who are you stupid peasants to like someone that\nthe media hasn&amp;#039;t TOLD you to support?!\n\nNo matter how much money Ron Paul raises, or how many supporters he\nhas, the statist propagandists will treat it like a fluke--an\ninsignificant anomaly which really doesn&amp;#039;t matter at all. Both\nDemocrat and Republican talking heads are doing it constantly. And\nif you watch closely, every once in a while you can catch a glimpse\nof the terror in their eyes, when they contemplate the possibility\nthat someone who actually believes in the Constitution might win.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nLarken Rose &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.larkenrose.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.larkenrose.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(P.S.
