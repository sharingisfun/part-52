But as time passed and Evan has made up with Bruce, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s gone onto bigger and better things. Newly elected to Washington D.C. as a congressman, Evan has left Buffalo, New York in pursuit of a greater calling. But that calling isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t serving in the illustrious ranks of America\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s politics, but being summoned by the Almighty himself (Morgan Freeman), who has handed Evan the task of building a new ark, much as Noah did before. With time passing by and his family belittled by Evan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s newfound realization, Evan will have to do the work that God has given him in what promises to be an unusual adventure for a man who just wanted to serve his country, might actually be serving humanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:530a53a3db18228d8eb354a4b7cb10ed4709866d","amp;dn":"Evan.Almighty%5B2007%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-tespio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"530a53a3db18228d8eb354a4b7cb10ed4709866d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,10,83,163,219,24,34,141,142,179,84,164,183,203,16,237,71,9,134,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
