His extreme fear of a nuclear holocaust leads him to build an enormous self-sustaining fallout shelter beneath his suburban San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles home. One night, while he and his pregnant wife, Helen, are entertaining guests, when a family friend comes to inform him that John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev are getting into a debate, they turn on their television, and watch in horror. When the Cuban Missile Crisis begins, they ask their guests to leave, and they head down into the shelter. Meanwhile, a USAF pilot has engine problems with his F-86 Sabre; he is ordered to eject, believing his jet will crash into the Pacific Ocean. Just as they descend into the shelter, the plane veers off and crashes into the Webber household home, leaving their friends and family to believe the family has died, and the family, having seen the resulting fireball just as they lock themselves in their shelter, believing that the unthinkable has happened and that they are the sole survivors of a nuclear war. The locks on the shelter are set for 35 years and cannot be overridden by anyone inside or outside the shelter - for &quot;their own protection&quot; according to Calvin Webber.\n\n\nRipped and compressed by...187","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f6b9fd59c9c481c4d72dabfe997f913bc8b2bb7","amp;dn":"Blast+from+the+Past...187","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f6b9fd59c9c481c4d72dabfe997f913bc8b2bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,107,159,213,156,156,72,28,77,114,218,191,233,151,249,19,188,139,43,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
