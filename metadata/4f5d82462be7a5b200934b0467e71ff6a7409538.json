It is also hardly lacking in Hitchcockian cinematic inventiveness, such as a famous, often-imitated sequence in which some smooching between stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is intercut with a fireworks show that just happens to be going on outside in a Riviera setting. Grant plays a reformed cat burglar who is suspected of reviving his trade, though he knows someone else is using his old methods. A very enjoyable experience, but don&amp;#039;t get this confused with Hitchcock&amp;#039;s other Cary Grant film of that decade, which was a masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5d82462be7a5b200934b0467e71ff6a7409538","amp;dn":"Hitchcock+-+To+Catch+A+Thief+1955.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5d82462be7a5b200934b0467e71ff6a7409538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,93,130,70,43,231,165,178,0,147,75,4,103,231,31,246,167,64,149,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
