His strength never ceases and he becomes stronger and stronger. He is kind and pure of heart.. a friend to even his enemies at times. He is the central point of DBZ, but not the only point.\n\nThroughout the series, he learns of his Saiyan heritage, finding that he was born of an alien human-like race that has an ability to concentrate energy called Kai (or ki) to create energy blasts, fly, etc. They are born with a natural instinct to fight, and conquer entire planets to sale to the highest bidder.\n\nThat is only the beginning of DBZ, there are 200 episodes or so of a previous series called Dragonball that explain Goku\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s childhood-into-adult hood. DBZ covers him from his early twenties or so all the way until he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s over 50 years old.\n\nThe show has sparked 13 movies and two specials.. and much more. Some of the movies are dubbed in english, while others are only available in Japanese subtitled versions.\n\nANYWAY, this show is specatacular, and takes forever to explain every aspect of the storyline. The ORIGINAL Japanese version has much better music and voice acting, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll admit. And the English versions (at least early episodes) were edited to death, the show still holds what makes it magic.\n\nThe beginning of the series will re-air on Cartoon Network as of May 2002. I suggest you begin watching. Do NOT let the animation, or the voice-acting, or bad editing of this first saga shake you away. The show takes time to understand and become interested in, but once your there, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll be hooked.\n\nThere are over 290 episodes of DBZ, and the animation gets much better, as does the storyline. Just keep watching, trust me... your gonna love it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d2d27a8611d5853b51f89306d7afdbe9ebb25e","amp;dn":"DBZ+Season+1+Disc+1+%5Bremastered%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d2d27a8611d5853b51f89306d7afdbe9ebb25e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,210,210,122,134,17,213,133,59,81,248,147,6,215,175,219,233,235,178,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
