Mastered by Steve Hoffman from the original first generation master tapes in 1992. You&amp;#039;ve really never heard these songs sound this good. Gives you an idea of what Patti Smith&amp;#039;s &quot;Easter&quot; or ELO&amp;#039;s &quot;Face the Music&quot; would sound like if mastered by Steve. \n\nRipped by EAC to FLAC. \n\nENJOY! =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22ff86358a93ce9f046800ac7ac1fa98ac1e74c","amp;dn":"Rock+of+the+70%5C%27s%2C+Vol.+1+-+Mastered+by+Steve+Hoffman+%28Audioph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22ff86358a93ce9f046800ac7ac1fa98ac1e74c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,47,248,99,88,169,60,233,240,70,128,10,199,172,31,169,138,193,231,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
