But then the crazy Mayflower couple blackmail him to steal some of the works of Leonardo da Vinci. If he refuses, they threaten to kill his friend Tommy.\n\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/\n\n\nAlright. Let&amp;#039;s have some Q and A:\n\nQ: Section 8, why are your mp4 releases so large?\n\nA: I can spell it out real simply. They are of very high quality. They have not been resized and shrunk to a horizontal resolution of 640 like many releases. They retain their original horizontal resolution of 720. If you compare these releases to the original DVD material I think you will be hard pressed to notice a difference. The difference is transparent to the human eye. I encode my movies to be the same quality as the original material when viewed on my 92 inch HD screen.\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net!\n\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Hudson Hawk.mp4\nDate: 22/07/2007 19:39:38\nSize: 1,555,996,944 bytes (1483.914 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:39:58 (5998.121666 s)\nContainer type: MP4/MOV\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCreation time: 21/07/2007 23:35:27 UTC\nModification time: 21/07/2007 23:35:27 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (mp4a) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nAudio streams: 1\n\n[ About quality ]\n\nResolution: VERY HIGH (720 x 464)\nWidth: multiple of 16 (GOOD)\nHeight: multiple of 16 (GOOD)\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec: avc1\nResolution: 720 x 464\nFrame aspect ratio: 45:29 = 1.551724\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 45:29 = 1.551724\nFramerate: 23.976023 fps\nNumber of frames: 143808\nBitrate: 1943.158410 kbps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec: mp4a\nBitrate: 129.046089 kbps\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 24000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77d49f9c2e908db07e80c10f8890294afa88cc96","amp;dn":"Hudson+Hawk-SeCtIoN8+%7BSharego.net%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77d49f9c2e908db07e80c10f8890294afa88cc96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,212,159,156,46,144,141,176,126,128,193,15,136,144,41,74,250,136,204,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
