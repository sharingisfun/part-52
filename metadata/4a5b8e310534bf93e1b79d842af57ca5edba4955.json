During his seven years in the Illinois state Senate, working families have been his top priority.\n\nIn February 2007, Obama announced his decision to run in the 2008 Presidential election, but he was making news long before. After he was the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review, he became a best-selling author and the third African-American ever elected to Senate. With the chance to become the first African-American President, Obama continues to blur racial lines and boundaries.\n\nHear about the experiences that shaped this unique individual in an upbringing that moved him from Hawaii to Indonesia to working as a community organizer in the toughest neighborhoods of Chicago. See what sets Obama apart from his Democratic opponents in the 2008 primaries and what attributes may seat him in the White House.\n\nFile Name ..........: BIOGRAPHY.Barack.Obama.XviD.AC3.avi\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 700.01 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n\nVideo Length .......: 00:45:16\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1906 KB/s\nResolution .........: 592 x 448\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.32:1\nFramerate ..........: 29.97 FPS\nQuality Factor .....: 0.239 B/px\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 256 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5b8e310534bf93e1b79d842af57ca5edba4955","amp;dn":"BIOGRAPHY.Barack.Obama.XviD.AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5b8e310534bf93e1b79d842af57ca5edba4955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,91,142,49,5,52,191,147,225,183,157,132,42,245,124,165,237,186,73,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
