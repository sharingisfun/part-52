There are now at least 8 members of the committee in favor of impeachment, six of whom are among the 24 co-sponsors of Congressman Dennis Kucinich&amp;#039;s resolution to impeach Cheney.\n\nAstonishingly (or not, depending on your perspective), the Wexler/Gutierrez/Baldwin op ed was rejected by every major newspaper they submitted it to, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Miami Herald.\n\nTo counter this media blackout, Congressman Wexler has set up a website at http://www.wexlerwantshearings.com where you can read the op ed and sign his petition to begin impeachment hearings for Dick Cheney. Initially he hoped to get 50,000 signatures; in a few short days almost 100,000 people have signed up and the list is growing rapidly. Although this massive outpouring of support from around the country comes as no surprise to me, it shocked the Congressman (and crashed his server!). Perhaps some folks in Congress are finally starting to get the message that America wants impeachment!\n\nRepresentative Wexler now wants to see if he can get 250,000 people to sign the call for impeachment. Please add your name and encourage everyone you know to add theirs at http://www.wexlerwantshearings.com. This isn&amp;#039;t being covered in the newspapers so the only way most people are going to find out about this is if you tell them. Please, pass it on!\n\nHappy holidays,\n\nJacob Park\nwww.a28.org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f6c9d54271c4c1720ec2aa7494b1320ea70e06","amp;dn":"Judiciary+Members+Demand+Cheney+Impeachment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f6c9d54271c4c1720ec2aa7494b1320ea70e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,246,201,213,66,113,196,193,114,14,194,170,116,148,177,50,14,167,14,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
