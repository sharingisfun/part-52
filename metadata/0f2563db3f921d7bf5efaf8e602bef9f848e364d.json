The game itself is simple and isn&amp;#039;t meant to be taken seriously, but hopefully it can provide at least a few minutes of entertainment for you. The game itself was written as a school project (think high school here people) and within class time constraints to meet a certain level of quality.\n\nReally funny, and kind of fun too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f2563db3f921d7bf5efaf8e602bef9f848e364d","amp;dn":"DeadBabiesX-Xbox+Homebrew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f2563db3f921d7bf5efaf8e602bef9f848e364d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,37,99,219,63,146,29,123,245,239,175,142,96,43,239,159,132,142,54,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
