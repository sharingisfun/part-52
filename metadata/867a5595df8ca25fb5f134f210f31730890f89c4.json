If not, dire consequences will follow. However, Godzilla is once again on the rampage, and Mechagodzilla is Japan&amp;#039;s only defense.  Written by Oliver Chu \n-imdb.com\n\n-A good movie if you like to see men in rubber suits beating the shit out of each other.  It&amp;#039;s the English-dub version because I couldn&amp;#039;t figure out how to rip with the subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867a5595df8ca25fb5f134f210f31730890f89c4","amp;dn":"Godzilla%3A+Tokyo+SOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867a5595df8ca25fb5f134f210f31730890f89c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,122,85,149,223,140,162,95,181,241,52,242,16,243,23,48,137,15,137,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
