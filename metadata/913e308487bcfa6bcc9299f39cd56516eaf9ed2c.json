Fresh off the yard after a 2.5 million dollar makeover, the USS Eisenhower is the pinnacle of aircraft carrier technology. Powered by multi-megawatt nuclear reactors, an air wing of 85 planes, and next-generation radar and combat capabilities, she has global strike capability. But before the Navy will deploy her to the Persian Gulf, she must prove her worth by winning a grueling, two-week exercise that pits two carrier battle groups - the USS Eisenhower and the USS Roosevelt - against each other. Its a massive war game that involves live ordnance and real bombs. Each carrier will be deployed with a full arsenal of fighter jets, destroyers, battleships, cruisers and submarines. Explorer has negotiated access to embed in the US Navys JTFEX, or Joint Task Force Exercise, which has never been captured by documentary cameras. Following critical members of the USS Eisenhowers crew - a fighter pilot, an Air Boss, and a member of the flight deck crew - well immerse viewers in the grueling missions and round-the-clock tension of this massive war game. With lipstick cameras mounted in cockpits and Hi-Def cameras following over-their-shoulders, well capture the intensity, adrenaline and real risks of life aboard a Super Carrier. Through this immersive human experience, well get equally immersed in the carriers twenty-first century technologyits weapons, its fighter planes, its engineering. This is the story of a super carrierwhere 6000 men and women run one of the most complex machines ever built.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\n\nVideo Codec.......: MPEG-2\nAudio Codec.......: AC3\nAudio Channels....: s,0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:913e308487bcfa6bcc9299f39cd56516eaf9ed2c","amp;dn":"07.12.19.Explorer-SuperCarrier%40silu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"913e308487bcfa6bcc9299f39cd56516eaf9ed2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,62,48,132,135,188,250,107,204,146,153,243,156,213,101,22,234,249,237,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
