Seems there was a problem with the original torrent\n\n\n\nTed &amp; The Cheesy Lion were a comedy band who are now sadly defunct.\n\nWe used to take famous songs and rip them off with our own lyrics or write original &quot;funnies&quot; all in a Glasgow/West of Scotland style. The CD was recorded about 15 years ago.\n\nHave a listen, leave a comment.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6557af3e107fc0b529d253087856ebbbe24007f","amp;dn":"Ted+%26+The+Cheesy+Lion.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6557af3e107fc0b529d253087856ebbbe24007f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,85,122,243,225,7,252,11,82,157,37,48,135,133,110,187,190,36,0,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
