Wanting to keep a connection with her sister Jodie, Zoe suggested helping family friend Rosa Monckton to raise both awareness and much needed funds for the charity Downside Up, which she is patron of. Downside up provide vital support to children with Downs Syndrome in Russia.\n\nZoe approached Rosa with the idea of offering the track Tears in Heaven as a download to the public with all the proceeds going directly to Downside Up. Tears in Heaven was the perfect choice as Zoe recorded the Eric Clapton classic as a dedication to Jodie. Rosa was delighted with Zoes generous gesture.\n\nTears in Heaven, along with a bonus track of She moved Through The Fair taken from Zoes first album Little Ray of Light which is no longer available can be downloaded from 12th November 2007.\n\nPlease help ZoÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« gives hope and much needed support to the Downs children of Russia, who deserve to live a decent dignified life!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a00230c5b9cd62f9bae809c024fa629ebab71aa","amp;dn":"Zoe+Mace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a00230c5b9cd62f9bae809c024fa629ebab71aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,0,35,12,91,156,214,47,155,174,128,156,2,79,166,41,235,171,113,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
