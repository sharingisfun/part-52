Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&amp;#039;s brace gave the Red Devils victory in last season&amp;#039;s fixture, while Wayne Rooney struck twice to help his side beat the Magpies by the same 2-0 scoreline in 2005/06. Rooney has scored six goals in the last six league games against Newcastle so will no doubt lead his side&amp;#039;s attack, if fit.\n\nLiverpool visited Middlesbrough where they had come away without a win on their five previous visits, while Arsenal hosted Birmingham and Aston Villa played Reading. Everton and Manchester City met in a clash which could have repercussions for both their hopes of qualifying for Europe next season. Plus, West Ham and Fulham faced each other in a London derby while Pride Park was the venue for a relegation battle between Derby and Wigan.\n\nArsenal VS. Birmingham\nAston Villa VS.
