Instead, the capricious British officer in charge challenges them to a game of cricket, a game totally alien and unknown to them. If they win, they get their wish; if they lose, however, the increased tax burden will destroy their lives. The people are terrified, but one man thinks the challenge is worth staking their entire future on. Will he convince the villagers to give it their best shot?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis movie is a DVDrip (XVID)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6efce4c3cad7a4059ae9e2baf1f6c6785a8cd369","amp;dn":"Lagaan_XVID_Dutch_subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6efce4c3cad7a4059ae9e2baf1f6c6785a8cd369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,252,228,195,202,215,164,5,154,233,226,186,241,246,198,120,90,140,211,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
