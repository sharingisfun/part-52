Her younger sister Ako is training to be a nurse, while Haruto has already become a neurologist at the hospital Aya was once treated at. The loss of Aya strongly affects Haruto, causing him to lose sight of himself. But after he meets Mizuki, a 14-year-old patient who has given up on living, he feels compelled to share with her the story of Aya&amp;#039;s life.\n[img]http://wiki.d-addicts.com/static/images/thumb/b/b6/220px-DVDcoverspecial1lot.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae5dd4a1a7c54507c6b8e042f00395cf7a7f4fdd","amp;dn":"1+Litre+of+Tears+Special+eng+hardsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae5dd4a1a7c54507c6b8e042f00395cf7a7f4fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,93,212,161,167,197,69,7,198,184,224,66,240,3,149,207,122,127,79,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
