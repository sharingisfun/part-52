This patch will replace them with the \n  Japanese.\n  \n                    -- Release Notes --\n  \n  I didn&amp;#039;t realize xdelta (http://code.google.com/p/xdelta) was so\n  robust for patching binary files with structural changes.\n\n  Avoiding such changes used to be a major headache... in fact, I\n  thank that is what caused the temporary voice problem I&amp;#039;ve seen\n  people complain about in ToA.  I guess a proper patch this way is\n  in order. :)\n     \n  Anyway, the included runme.bat script will invoke xdelta to patch\n  from Final Fantasy XII UNDUB 1.0 to 1.01.\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1232fd3c38f5429693b0f758b2387770fabaf31c","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+XII+USA+UNDUB+1.01+PATCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1232fd3c38f5429693b0f758b2387770fabaf31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,50,253,60,56,245,66,150,147,176,247,88,178,56,119,112,250,186,243,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
