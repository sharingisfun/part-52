The undecoded MP3 files were cut with mp3DirectCut, optimized with mp3packer (removing a buffer underrun of frame &quot;0&quot;) and MP3val (correcting the MP3-file length reported by the MP3 header for proper seeking). Foobar2k was used to add ID3-tags, to avoid clipping by scaling the Global Gain to 89dB and to add ReplayGain tags. Final quality (TMB HQ): 192kbps 44.1kHz VBR stereo MP3. All MP3-players will play the files as usual. After all the optimizations, a third (for normal stereo mp3-players invisible) channel with 32-48kbps 5.1 surround extension has been added with the MP3SX converter. This results in a final bitrate for both sets of 224-240kbps. Check the Fraunhofer explanations HERE.
