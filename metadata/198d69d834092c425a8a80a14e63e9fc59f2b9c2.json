Produced on little budget and even less thought, this film will induce more laughter than any other pseudo-science documentary ever produced.  The highlight is the proposed connection between UFO contact and the Mormon religion.  Yes, it appears that Mormonism is just Scientology without the celebrities! ;) \n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:198d69d834092c425a8a80a14e63e9fc59f2b9c2","amp;dn":"Overlords+of+the+UFO+%281976%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"198d69d834092c425a8a80a14e63e9fc59f2b9c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,141,105,216,52,9,44,66,90,138,128,161,78,99,233,252,89,242,185,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
