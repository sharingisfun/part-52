The band came from the ashes of Joe and Dustin's previous band Partial Discharge. When Partial Discharge split, the two decided to start over. They soon found Jeff, and Jake and began to write new songs. From the beginning Slavereign Nation set out to be something unique in the central Illinois metal scene, by not limiting themselves to any one type of the genre. Tapping into a range of influences such as In Flames, Shadows Fall, Fear Factory, Tool, Killswitch Engage, Nine Inch Nails, As I Lay Dying, White Zombie, Dry Kill Logic, and Type O Negative, to create a blast of heavy soundcapes fueled by socially relevant and political messages. \n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/slavereignnation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7395a09845204825600733ba69a7b1d1b6f40816","amp;dn":"Slavereign+Nation+Mind+Spectral+Single","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7395a09845204825600733ba69a7b1d1b6f40816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,149,160,152,69,32,72,37,96,7,51,186,105,167,177,209,182,244,8,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
