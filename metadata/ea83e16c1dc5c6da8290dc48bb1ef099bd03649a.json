JAFFA is quite pleased to be able to\nbring you everything (of note) that this great band put down on record. Hell's Ditch was originally issued in 1990.\n\n\n&quot;From the beginning, the Clash had been one of the Pogues' primary influences. So it's most appropriate that Joe\nStrummer produced Hell's Ditch. The former Clash guitarist wisely and insightfully avoids smoothing out too many of\nthe date's rough edges, and seems to encourage rawness and go-for-broke passion (which generally serve the band well).\nThis time, elements of Middle Eastern and Latin music are added to the Pogues' intriguing rock/Irish folk mix. It's\nhard to miss the effect that drugs and alcohol were having on the self-destructive Shane MacGowan, whose vocals are\neven more garbled than they were on Peace And Love. In fact, he sounds like he's in a drunken stupor most of the time.\nNonetheless, his songwriting is often superb and brilliant on this risk-taking, if uneven, project.&quot;  (AMG)\n\nhttp://www.pogues.com\n\n\n---\n\n\nGroup News: JAFFA is looking for: A few good men. Or women. You can probably guess what for.. You have\nto be a totally hard-core bad-ass individual who's on irc 24/7, but at the same time we don't want uber-\nserious, super-boring ones, nor opportunists, nor those who speak lies. Nor robinson-jerry. Also, you\nhave to be 18 years old minimum, and like Music a lot, and be familiar with, or at least have heard of,\nbands/artists such as Ramones, Dropkick Murphys, or Flogging Molly. That's it. If you think you fit the bill,\nall that's left to do is to somehow get in touch with the JAFFA Supreme Overmind. Someone you know may know\nsomeone else who has in turn once spoken to someone that..etc, etc, etc. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea83e16c1dc5c6da8290dc48bb1ef099bd03649a","amp;dn":"The_Pogues-Hells_Ditch-Remastered-2004-JAFFA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea83e16c1dc5c6da8290dc48bb1ef099bd03649a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,131,225,108,29,197,198,218,130,144,220,72,187,30,240,153,189,3,100,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
