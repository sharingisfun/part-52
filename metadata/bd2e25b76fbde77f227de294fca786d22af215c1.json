Frontiersman Lin McAdam (Stewart) is attempting to track down both his fatherÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s murderer and his one-of-a-kind rifle, the Winchester Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´73, as it passes among a diverse group of desperate characters, including a crazed highwayman (Dan Duryea), an immoral gunrunner (John McIntire), a savage young Indian chief (Rock Hudson) and McAdamÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s own murderous brother (Stephen McNally). Featuring Shelley Winters as the rifleÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s only rival for McAdamÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s interest and Tony Curtis in one of his first screen performances, the gripping tale of the men (and gun) who won the West is one of StewartÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s most memorable films and one of the genreÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s most enduring classics.\n\nDirector Anthony Mann \n\nCast James Stewart, Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, John McIntire, Will Geer\n\n Length 89 min\n\n Video Pal\nFull Frame 1.33:1 \n\nLanguages Dolby Digital 2.0: English, Italian, Spanish, Russian (Voice Over)\n\n Subtitles English, Spanish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish\n\nOther features\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access, Interview with James Stewart, Original Theatrical Trailer\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd2e25b76fbde77f227de294fca786d22af215c1","amp;dn":"Winchester+%C3%82%C2%B473+%5BMultilanguage%2Bmultisubtitulos%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd2e25b76fbde77f227de294fca786d22af215c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,46,37,183,111,189,231,127,34,125,226,148,252,167,134,210,42,242,21,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
