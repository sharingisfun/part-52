On a top-secret assignment, they must disguise themselves as Nazis and infiltrate a severely damaged Nazi U-boat. Once on board, they are to steal the Nazi&amp;#039;s top-secret decoding device and sink the sub before the Germans catch on to what&amp;#039;s really happening. Their mission is more dangerous and frightening than anything they could have ever imagined, but one which has the power to turn the tide of battle.\n\nWinner of the 2000 Oscar for Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing.
