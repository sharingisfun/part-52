You can use HFS (HTTP File Server) to send and receive files. It&amp;#039;s different from classic file sharing because it uses web technology to be more compatible with today&amp;#039;s Internet. Access your remote files, over the network.\nIt runs as a standalone executable and does not require any installation. The program is very easy to use, just drag a file into it to share it with the world. You can customize the port it is running on, specify the IP address and monitor connections from the tray icon.
