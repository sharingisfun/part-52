Bougyaku No Basyo   \n324 \n5. Terminal Chamber   \n6. Prismrider   \n7. Just Sit There \n\n\nDiscordance Axis - Our Last Day\nThis one is only kind of a DxAx release as it contains 2 original DxAx songs, 17 covers of DxAx by other bands, a complete noise remix of The Inalienable Dreamless by Merzbow and a single track from Jon Chang (DxAx vocalist) new band Gridlink. It&amp;#039;s worth it for the originals, the remix, Gridlink and the Melt Banana cover, but otherwise this is prolly just for collectors &amp; die hards...\n\nBands are as follows:\n1-2: Discordance Axis, 3-12: Cide Projeckt, 13-14: Gate, 15-17: Mortalized, 18: Melt Banana, 19: Noiseear, 20: Merzbow, 21: Gridlink  \n\n1.
