Since we liked the\n      same kind of music and bought the same records our music\n      became of great matter, specially since this was in our early\n      teenage years. We began however to write our own songs in a\n      very early state of our friendship, and even though we barely\n      could do anything even close to playing our instruments good\n      we managed to record 3 tracks on a tape. This must have been\n      nearly five years ago, today we are, thank god, older and\n      hopefully better musicians and songwriters... But everything\n      else is still just the same as back then, at least the most\n      important things. We still make music, and we are still\n      friends. And in the end that is a good thing, but sometimes\n      life has so much to offer, girls, school, parties and so on.\n      That it gets hard to play as much as one wish. But these\n      things are just important for a short matter of time,\n      eventually and as always The Band wins... Cause it always\n      does, and it always has to. Cause no matter what we will\n      always have our band! Say isn&amp;#039;t life kind of like a bicycle,\n      however let&amp;#039;s take a ride... /ByeByeBicycle!!!\n\n   _______________________________________________________________________\n\n      01-Westside                                                03:05\n      02-Footsteps                                               03:19\n      03-Sirens                                                  04:59\n                                                                -------\n                                                                 11:23 min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9026d676ae65e58dc85c535d3fdb4f4b49c63c","amp;dn":"Bye_Bye_Bicycle-Westside-%28CLOUDBERRY063%29-CDR-2007-pyt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9026d676ae65e58dc85c535d3fdb4f4b49c63c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,144,38,214,118,174,101,229,141,200,92,83,93,63,219,79,75,73,198,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
