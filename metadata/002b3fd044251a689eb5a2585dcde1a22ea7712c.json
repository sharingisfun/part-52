Some former members claim the Church uses a mind control technique to put opponents at a psychological disadvantage. During the course of his investigation, Sweeney is shouted at, spied on, visited in his hotel at midnight and chased around the streets of LA by strangers in hire cars.\n\n\n\n2.South Park ~Trapped in the Closet S9, E12 2005 11 16  avi\n\n174 mg \n\nTrapped in the Closet&quot;, the twelfth episode of the ninth season of the Comedy Central series South Park, originally aired on November 16, 2005. The plot of the episode centers on the South Park character Stan Marsh, as he joins Scientology in an attempt to find something &quot;fun and free&quot;. After the discovery of his surprisingly high &quot;thetan levels&quot;, he is recognized as the reincarnation of the founder of the church, L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nTom Cruise, who is featured in the episode, reportedly threatened &quot;to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn?t pull a repeat of the episode.&quot; Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast in March 2006, the episode &quot;Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls&quot; was shown instead.
