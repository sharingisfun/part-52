He dreams of a life where he can fly away from technology and overpowering bureaucracy, and spend eternity with the woman of his dreams. While trying to rectify the wrongful arrest of one Harry Buttle, Lowry meets the woman he is always chasing in his dreams, Jill Layton. Meanwhile, the bureaucracy has fingered him responsible for a rash of terrorist bombings, and both Sam and Jill&amp;#039;s lives are put in danger. \n\n\nMore info at www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/\nUser Rating: 8.0/10\n\n\n                            Media Information                            \nDisc Regions are                                          1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\nCSS Protected                                                          No\nUDF Format Type                                                     V1.02\nUDF Volume                                                         Brazil\nUDF Application id                                                       \nUDF Recording Date/Time (mm/dd/yyyy)                  01/12/2008 14:30:17\nFormat Capacity                                            4.36GB(4.68GB)\nBook Type                                                           DVD+R\nMedia Type                                                          DVD+R\nNumber of Layers                                                        1\n\nVideo Attributes:\n  Video compression mode: MPEG-2\n  TV system: 625/50 (PAL)\n  Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n  Display Mode: Only Letterbox\n  Source picture resolution: 720x576 (625/50)\n  Frame Rate: 25.00\n  Bitrate: 3.62Mbps\n\nAudio Attributes: \n  Audio Coding mode: Dolby Digital\n  Sampling Rate: 48kHz\n  Audio application mode: Not specified\n  Number of Audio channels: 2\n  Bitrate: 192 Kbps\n  Number of Audio streams: 1\n\nSubpicture Attribute:\n  Number of Subtitles: 5 (Danish, English, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be757860b07da19dc290107a110b09d4517088a","amp;dn":"Brazil+%281985%29+-+%28Danish%2C+English%2C+Finnish%2C+Norwegian%2C+Swedish%29+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be757860b07da19dc290107a110b09d4517088a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,231,87,134,11,7,218,25,220,41,1,7,161,16,176,157,69,23,8,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
