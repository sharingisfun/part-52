It keeps on the same paths as Bass Communion and Vidna Obmana.\nAlbum 2, takes a different approach, mixing the elements of drone and metal, similar to the likes of Sunn 0))), Neurosis, and a little Merzbow.\n\nHope you enjoy the songs as much as I enjoyed making them.\n\nCB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971292f2b4f54390e94a394aa52bcd614b452680","amp;dn":"Adronus+-+Destroia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971292f2b4f54390e94a394aa52bcd614b452680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,18,146,242,180,245,67,144,233,74,57,74,165,43,205,97,75,69,38,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
