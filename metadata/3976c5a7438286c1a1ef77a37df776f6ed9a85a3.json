Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3976c5a7438286c1a1ef77a37df776f6ed9a85a3","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B08.23.07%5D+-+David+Sereda.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3976c5a7438286c1a1ef77a37df776f6ed9a85a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,118,197,167,67,130,134,193,161,239,119,163,125,247,118,246,237,154,133,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
