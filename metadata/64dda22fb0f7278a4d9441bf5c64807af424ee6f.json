Eaten Alive (4:39)\n2. Kakera (6:53)\n3. Mirrors (4:48)\n4. Roses 3 (6:29)\n5. Winter Comes (2:13)\n6. Zero Eye (4:05)\n\nIts been a fair old while since we had Zainetica featured on the Collective, mainly due to the fact that &amp;#039;Winter Comes&amp;#039; is an ep that can only be released once a year and unfortunatley the release schedule didn&amp;#039;t permit release in 2006 - so, finally, after a slight delay of one year (!) we have a suitably winter themed ep for this time of year. Mellow beats and grooves and some cool retro ambience as the tracks melt into one another. Slight industrial tints here and there, a spot of elektro and you have what makes a curiously interesting and enjoyable release. Listen and bathe in the cold light of Zainetica.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64dda22fb0f7278a4d9441bf5c64807af424ee6f","amp;dn":"Zainetica+-+Winter+Comes+%5B2007%2FOgg%2Fq8+%28VBR%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64dda22fb0f7278a4d9441bf5c64807af424ee6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,221,162,47,176,247,39,138,77,148,65,191,92,100,128,122,244,36,238,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
