Picture and sound quality \nis fairly good. Most of the concert is filmed far away \nfrom the stage. So no real close-ups but a nice overal \nview. During &quot;If this is goodbye&quot;, the filmer is walking \ndownstairs to get closer to the stage. From that point on, \nthe picture quality is a lot better. Very nice version \nof &quot;Donkey Town&quot;, a song that was only played at the very \nstart of the tour. Also great to see &quot;All that matters&quot; in the setlist. \nComplete concert. Available on two DVD+R&amp;#039;s. \n\n\n\nMore info: \n\nVideo \nCodec : MPEG-2 Video \nCodec settings : AC3 \nBit rate : 6231Kbps \nAspect ratio : 4/3 \nFrame rate : 25 fps \nStandard : PAL \nAudio \nCodec :DVD-LPCM6AUDIO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9f8c1e7b44458f214033e3a3c44c0a172dc3c9","amp;dn":"unofficial+Mark+Knopfler+%26+Emmylou+Harris+Copenhagen+2006+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c9f8c1e7b44458f214033e3a3c44c0a172dc3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,159,140,30,123,68,69,143,33,64,51,227,163,196,76,10,23,45,195,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
