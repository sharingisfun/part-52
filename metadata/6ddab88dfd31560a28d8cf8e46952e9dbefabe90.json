Those changes occured after the acclaim album El Ang&amp;eacute;l \n\nCa&amp;iacute;do (The Fallen Angel) was released in 2001, awaiting a \n\nfollower to confirm Avalanch as one of the most influential \n\nSpanish band ever.\nBack with a new line-up, a new logo, Avalanch was ready to \n\npresent their new effort called Los Poetas Han Muerto (Poets Have \n\nDied).\nThe great cover by Luis Royo is just the reflection of the music: \n\ngreat songs filled with creativity, emotions, power, in a very \n\nwell structured way: a high class album ranging somewhere between \n\nhard rock, heavy, progressive and maybe a bit of power metal. \n\nGreat lyrics, intelligent and worth a bunch of poems, supported \n\nby great vocals, featuring Andre Matos (Shaman) in the song Del \n\ncielo a la tierra (literally From the sky to the ground, or \n\nHeaven and Earth) that transmit a kind of force to the songs, \n\nmaking them all catchy and meaningful.\nThe music in itself is not outstanding, I mean, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just \n\nsome musicians showing up, no this album is not about that. It's \n\nloud when it needs to be loud, soft when it needs to be soft, and \n\nso are the solos, not present just to illustrate a sudden \n\noutburst in oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands but to give depth, to add melody to the \n\nsongs. All the songs are composed in a very clever way, and \n\nproduced the same way.\nThe only problem I can find is in the length of some songs. They \n\narenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t very long, something like 6 minutes on average, but maybe \n\nsome songs would have been more effective if shortened by 20 to \n\n40 seconds.\nI know some of you may say: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh yeah, it sounds really worth my \n\nmoney, butÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ they sing in Spanish, and I know nothing of Spanish!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nTo that I say: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to learn!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But I could also say that by \n\nthe time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m writing this review, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to release an \n\nEnglish version, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mother EarthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, featuring a cover of U2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\nWhere The Streets Have No Name.\nI havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard this English version, but knowing Alberto Rionda \n\nis a kind of genius when it comes to his band I bet you can all \n\nrush to your music store and look for it, or order it, or at \n\nleast check the few mp3s available at their website.\nAll in all you just have to discover the amazing work of \n\nAvalanch!\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to end this review with the introduction Alberto wrote \n\nfor the song by song of this album, available on their website:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Siempre he cre&amp;iacute;do que el principio y el fin de una letra es la \n\nintenci&amp;oacute;n de transmitir un sentimiento, una creencia, una \n\nexperiencia, una idea... Algo muy simple puede ser muy complicado \n\nde expresar, y algo complejo puede llegar a transmitirse con una \n\nsola palabra. No es una ciencia exacta, pero creo que si la \n\nintenci&amp;oacute;n del autor queda claramente reflejada en ella, y alguien \n\nes capaz de captarla y de interpretarla, entonces podemos afirmar \n\nque se ha producido un peque&amp;ntilde;o milagro en ese complejo ecosistema \n\ncoraz&amp;oacute;n/mente/almaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always thought that the beginning and the end of a lyric is \n\nthe will to transmit a feeling, a belief, an experience, an \n\nidea... Something very simple can be very difficult to express, \n\nand something complex may be transmitted by one single word only. \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not an exact science, but I think that if the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will \n\nis clearly reflected in it, and if someone is able to capture and \n\ninterpret it, then we can say that a small miracle has happened \n\nin this complex ecosystem heart/mind/soulÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nAlberto Rionda[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ddab88dfd31560a28d8cf8e46952e9dbefabe90","amp;dn":"Avalanch+-+Los+Poetas+Han+Muerto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ddab88dfd31560a28d8cf8e46952e9dbefabe90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,218,184,141,253,49,86,10,40,216,207,142,70,149,46,157,190,250,190,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
