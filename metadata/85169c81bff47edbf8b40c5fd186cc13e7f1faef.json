Inspired by real events, Bryce Courtenay&amp;#039;s new novel tells the story of three people from vastly differing backgrounds. All they have in common is a tough beginning in life. Jack McKenzie is a harmonica player, soldier, dreamer and small-time professional fisherman from a tiny island in Bass Strait. Nicole Lenoir-Jourdan is a strong-willed woman hiding from an ambiguous past in Shanghai. Larger than life, Private Jimmy Oldcorn was once a street kid and leader of a New York gang. Together, they reap a vast and not always legitimate fortune from the sea. Brother Fish is an inspiring human drama of three lives brought together and changed forever by the extraordinary events of recent history. But most of all it is about the power of friendship and love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85169c81bff47edbf8b40c5fd186cc13e7f1faef","amp;dn":"Bryce+Courtenay+-+Brother+Fish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85169c81bff47edbf8b40c5fd186cc13e7f1faef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,22,156,129,191,244,126,219,248,180,12,95,209,134,204,19,231,241,250,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
