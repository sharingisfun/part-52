Combining different styles of music ranging from death metal to industrial and rock oriented genres.\n\nChainfists style is a mixture of high profiled progressive rock with a touch of violent, yet groovy, though hardhitting metal beats. With frontman Paul Owens charismatic voice, the two axemen Michael Kopietz and Tim Madsens mixture of metal meets rock guitar together with the deepsubs of Braca Pedersen on bass, filling out the canmans Jesper Heldelbachs highpowered drum beats.\n\nOne thing is for sure: you do not want to miss this quartet when Chainfist hits the stage with a energetic stageshow that is not to be forgotten. \n\nwww.chainfst.net\n\nwww.myspace.com/chainfist\n\nwww.chainfist.mymusic.dk\n\n\nSpread the word and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa8b1a26289c5c027d73f170b20987618297983a","amp;dn":"Chainfist+-+Niflheim+Recordings+April+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa8b1a26289c5c027d73f170b20987618297983a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,139,26,38,40,156,92,2,125,115,241,112,178,9,135,97,130,151,152,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
