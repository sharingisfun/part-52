In fact at the time the series was first aired it was given poor time slots by station managers that did not want it broadcast, and the program was even banned in France. Despite this suppression, the series went on to become a smash success leading to the best selling non-fiction book of 1980 and a follow-up series in 1990. \n\n\nOFFICIAL SITES\n\nhttp://freetochoose.net/tv_1980.html\nhttp://www.ideachannel.com/FreeToChoose.htm\n\n\nTorrents for the entire series available at MVGroup.org or listed on the torrent search sites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2f830d881f013bd5451a6eefc5f228dc0f7a98","amp;dn":"PBS+Free+to+Choose+1990+Schwarzenegger+Intro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef2f830d881f013bd5451a6eefc5f228dc0f7a98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,47,131,13,136,31,1,59,213,69,26,110,239,197,242,40,220,15,122,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
