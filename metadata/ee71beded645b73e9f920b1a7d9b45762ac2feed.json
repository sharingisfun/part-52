The character \n\noriginally appeared in the opening and closing credit sequences of the 1963 live-action feature film The Pink \n\nPanther. The popularity of the character spawned a series of animated short films, and the character would appear \n\nin the opening sequence of every film in The Pink Panther series (except A Shot in the Dark and Inspector \n\nClouseau). The cool cat starred in one-hundred twenty-four shorts (either theatrical or made-for-television), ten \n\ntelevision shows and three prime-time television specials.\n\nThe animated Pink Panther character&amp;#039;s initial appearance in the live action film&amp;#039;s title sequence, directed by Friz \n\nFreleng, was such a success with audiences and United Artists that the studio signed Freleng and his DePatie-\n\nFreleng Enterprises studio to a multi-year contract for a series of Pink Panther theatrical cartoon shorts.\n\nThe first entry in the series, 1964&amp;#039;s The Pink Phink, featured the Panther harassing his foil, a little moustached \n\nman resembling an animated version of the feature films&amp;#039; Inspector Clouseau, by constantly trying to paint the \n\nlittle man&amp;#039;s blue house pink. The Pink Phink won the 1964 Academy Award for Animated Short Film, and subsequent \n\nshorts in the series, usually featuring the Panther opposite the little man, were successful releases.\n\nIn an early series of Pink Panther animated cartoons, the Pink Panther generally remained silent, speaking only in \n\ntwo theatrical shorts, Sink Pink and Pink Ice. Rich Little provided the Panther&amp;#039;s voice in the latter shorts, \n\nmodelling it on that of David Niven (who had portrayed Clouseau&amp;#039;s jewel-thief nemesis in the original live-action \n\nfilm). Years later Little would overdub Niven&amp;#039;s voice for Trail of the Pink Panther and Curse of the Pink Panther.\n\nAll of the animated Pink Panther shorts utilized the distinctive jazzy theme music composed by Henry Mancini for \n\nthe 1963 feature film.\n\n\n[Video]DISC 1\n\n1: Pink-Come Tax 12/20/68\n2: Pink-A-Rella 01/08/69\n3: Pink Pest Control 02/12/69\n4: Think Before You Pink 03/19/69\n5: Slink Pink 04/02/69\n6: In The Pink Of The Night 05/18/69\n7: Pink On The Cob 05/29/69\n8: Extinct Pink 06/20/69\n9: A Fly In The Pink 06/23/71\n\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nOrig.
