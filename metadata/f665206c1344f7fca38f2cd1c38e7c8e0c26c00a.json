Myth that relies on inexplicable events, gossip, wives&amp;#039; tales and just a little &quot;bullshit&quot;. Who is this strange recluse? Does he even exist? Is he alive and well in the hills of Tennessee?\n\nf so, it might explain some of the strange occurrences in recent years surrounding mysterious deaths &amp; gruesome murders. It might even explain what overcame our film crew during production.\n\nJust what lurks under the seedy underbelly of small town America? No one truly wants to know the secrets that lie herein. The &quot;good ol&amp;#039; boys&quot; have been cooking up a strange brew of sex, drugs, skunk, &amp; rock n roll. Like a skunkape; windego, bigfoot, sasquatch, or yeti. They&amp;#039;ve made their own Frankenstein.\n\nIs the legend true? Are these events connected? Could this possibly have happened under the watchful eyes of the entire community?\n\nSome of the contents are based on actual events in Putnam County, Tennessee.\n\nSome of the events that happened during filming, happened.\n\nSome of the events depicted probably never happened at all.\n\nYou decide.\n\nThe Legend of Crazy George is a chilling film, leaving us with the disturbing feeling that weÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½re sensing a danger our fear cannot articulate.
