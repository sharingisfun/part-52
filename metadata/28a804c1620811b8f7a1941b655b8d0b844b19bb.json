Superb period detail, performers who seem to have been born for these roles, and a hearty helping of Wodehouse wit make these shows essential viewing for anyone in search of a sophisticated chuckle. All six episodes are included here: &quot;Jeeves Saves the Cow-Creamer&quot;, &quot;A Plan for Gussie&quot;, &quot;Pearls Mean Tears&quot;, &quot;Jeeves in the Country&quot;, &quot;Kidnapped!&quot; and &quot;Jeeves the Matchmaker&quot;.\n\n\n/Fidelio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28a804c1620811b8f7a1941b655b8d0b844b19bb","amp;dn":"Jeeves.And.Wooster.Series2.DVDR-Fidelio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28a804c1620811b8f7a1941b655b8d0b844b19bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,168,4,193,98,8,17,184,247,161,148,27,101,91,141,11,132,75,25,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
