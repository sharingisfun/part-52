Then reality hit (ran out of $$)  But what the hey - after 3 months even I ran out.\n\nThis Cd that I scooped from one of the DJ&amp;#039;s at Tony&amp;#039;s Disco really brings back memories for me.  Many nights, not much sleep.............\n\nSorry but I don&amp;#039;t remember all the names in the titles.  I&amp;#039;m not trying to be rude or anything but I thought some of you might enjoy the music even if it is getting like really ancient.\n\nIf you know any of the titles then please correct - thanks guys :)\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d7c10caeac98d327953e9a487d7e7327fd00db","amp;dn":"Pattaya+Club+Music+Number+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d7c10caeac98d327953e9a487d7e7327fd00db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,215,193,12,174,172,152,211,39,149,62,154,72,125,126,115,39,253,0,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
