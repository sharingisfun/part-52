Oxygene was originally released in 1976. It set the the standard for all New Age Synthesizer Music that would follow.\n\n&quot;OXYGENE ? Live In Your Living Room is what Jean Michel Jarre has \ncreated to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his super-hit album and \nwill come in 3 formats: CD album, CD+DVD, and CD+3D DVD. The \nstereoscopic 3D video and surround sound gives the unique \nimpression of being right there next to Jean Michel and his instruments \nwhile seated on your living room sofa.\n\nJean Michel was accompanied by three musicians for this live \nperformance, as the 8 track original masterpiece requires eight hands \nfor a live performance. It was played totally live in one take, without \ntape or hard-disk playback, by himself and Francis Rimbert, Claude \nSamard and Dominique Perrier.\n\nIt is the first concert to be filmed in stereoscopy, which is the next \ngiant step in audiovisual entertainment: Philips have developed a new \nplasma screen that delivers a 3D stereoscopy image visible without \nglasses - the film director James Cameron (Titanic) has patented a \nnew stereoscopic movie camera and is to release his next movie in \nstereoscopic 3D. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470bb6d84b222d6926fcfc02b35e072ffc4f27d5","amp;dn":"Jean+Michel+Jarre+-+Oxygene-+Live+In+Your+Living+Room%29+2007+New+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470bb6d84b222d6926fcfc02b35e072ffc4f27d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,11,182,216,75,34,45,105,38,252,252,2,179,94,7,47,252,79,39,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
