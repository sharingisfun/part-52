Its creators, Dr Jonez and Mr Misc Ill have dedicated their lives to music in different ways: Dr Jonez grew up on the rhythm of the beat through circuitry - an electronic producer in his own right. Mr Misc Ill has a purist attitude when it comes to music - A master of stringed instruments and natural sounds. Together they blend the natural with the unnatural. The result is this unique sound called Photo-Poetic.\n\n1) Machine from Another Planet \n2) Fight or Flight\n3) Sad and Crazy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f215dc210a53220e36fbaf641a62847d52029c16","amp;dn":"Photo-Poetic+Debut+Electronic+Downtempo+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f215dc210a53220e36fbaf641a62847d52029c16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,21,220,33,10,83,34,14,54,251,175,100,26,98,132,125,82,2,156,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
