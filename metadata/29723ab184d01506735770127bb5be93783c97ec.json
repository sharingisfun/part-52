Only the players actions will determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; its all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed evil or really evil! Played out with plenty of black humour and dark irony, the game will immerse players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n\n        Windows XP/Vista\n        DirectX 9.0c\n        Pentium 4 @ 2.4 GHz or Athlon 2400+\n        512 MB RAM\n        Graphics Card: GeForce FX5700 / Radeon 9500 or above\n        DirectX Compatible Sound Card\n        2x DVD-ROM Drive\n        4.5 GB Hard Drive Space\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
