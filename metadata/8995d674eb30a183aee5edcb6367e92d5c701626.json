Martin and Lewis are in for a real treat, as this musical is very funny plus has great show-stopping musical and dance numbers including \\\\\\&amp;#039;Ev\\\\\\&amp;#039;ry Street\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a Boulevard in Old New York\\\\\\&amp;#039; and has a romantic subplot filled out by the beautiful Janet Leigh. \n\nLiving It Up is a remake (with a gender change of the lead character) of the 1937 comedy Nothing Sacred, which was adapted into the Broadway musical Hazel Flagg - book by Ben Hecht, music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Bob Hilliard and story by James Street. \n\nHomer Flagg (Jerry Lewis) couldn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t be any more tired of living in Desert Hole, NM, where his job as a flag wavier for the fast-paced trains rushing by rarely stop. When his boss Isaiah Jackson (Walter Baldwin) is retiring to head off to New York City, Homer is so jealous he jumps on the train to stow away for the ride. In the first on many comedic moments Homer\\\\\\&amp;#039;s car gets unattached, he steals a car that\\\\\\&amp;#039;s radioactive - and the plot is on its way. \n\nDirectors: Norman Taurog \n\nWriter: Ben Hecht - play, story - James Street., screenplay - Jack Rose &amp; Melville Shavelson \n\nCast: Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Janet Leigh, Fred Clark, Edward Arnold Walter Baldwin\n\nDolby Digital Mono EspaÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol, InglÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, FrancÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s\n\nSubt.: EspaÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol, InglÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, DanÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, FinlandÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, FrancÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, HolandÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, Noruego, Sueco, InglÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s para sordos \n\nPAL\n\nVIDEO:\n\nSource:\n[X] PAL DVD5 \n\n[x] Untouched \n\nMENU:\n[x] Untouched \n\nEXTRAS:\n[x] Nothing on source .\n\nSaludos\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8995d674eb30a183aee5edcb6367e92d5c701626","amp;dn":"Living+It+Up+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8995d674eb30a183aee5edcb6367e92d5c701626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,149,214,116,235,48,161,131,174,229,237,203,99,103,233,45,92,112,22,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
