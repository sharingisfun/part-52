The Chinese title WÃƒÂº Ji?n DÃƒÂ o refers to Avici, the ultimate (lowest) level of hell in Buddhism, and literally means &quot;The Non-Stop Way&quot;. The English title, while similarly having connotations of Dante&amp;#039;s Inferno, is a play on words on internal affairs.\n\nInfernal Affairs initially received much publicity because of its star-studded cast of Tony Leung, Andy Lau, Anthony Wong, Eric Tsang, Kelly Chen and Sammi Cheng; original plot of undercover agents from both sides, and compact and swift storytelling style, which later rose to critical acclaim.\n\nThe film did exceptionally well in Hong Kong and was considered &quot;a box office miracle&quot;. It was heralded as a revival of Hong Kong cinema which at the time was considered to be direly lacking in creativity. Due to its commercial and critical success, Infernal Affairs was followed by the prequel Infernal Affairs II and the sequel Infernal Affairs III, both released in 2003.\n\nMiramax Films had also acquired the United States distribution rights to Infernal Affairs and the film was given a limited US theatrical release in 2004.\n\nThe 2006 film, The Departed, directed by Martin Scorsese, and stars Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson, was an adaptation of Infernal Affairs.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n   \n\n Cast\n\n    * Tony Leung - &quot;Yan&quot; - Chan Wing Yan (???)\n    * Andy Lau - Lau Kin Ming (???)\n    * Anthony Wong - Superintendent Wong Chi Shing (???)\n    * Eric Tsang - Hon Sam (??)\n    * Kelly Chen - Dr. Lee Sum Yee (???)\n    * Chapman To - Tsui Wai Keung (??)\n    * Sammi Cheng - Mary\n    * Edison Chen - Young Lau Kin Ming (?????)\n    * Shawn Yue - Young Chan Wing Yan (?????)\n    * Lam Ka Tung - Detective Lam Kwok Ping a.k.a &quot;Bee&quot; (??? &quot;?B&quot;)\n    * Ng Ting Yip - Inspector Ng (?SIR)\n    * Wan Chi Keung - Deputy Commissioner Leung (?SIR)\n    * Dion Lam - Del Piero\n    * Elva Hsiao - May\n\n Plot\n\nInfernal Affairs is about a cop named Yan who goes deep undercover into the Triad, and Triad member Ming, who infiltrates the police department. Each mole was planted by the rival organization to gain an advantage in intelligence over the other side. The more the moles become involved in their undercover lives, the more issues they have to cope with.\n\nThe film begins, after Yan and Ming converse at a hi-fi store where Yan works without knowing who each other is. A deal between Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer is interrupted by Superintendent Wong and his team due to Yan&amp;#039;s tip-off using Morse Code. Ming alerted Sam of the bust with enough time for Sam to order his minions to dispose of the cocaine so the police would not have any real evidence on their hands. Now Wong and Sam realize that they each have moles within their respective organizations, putting them in a race against time to root out the other mole.\n\nAt the same time, Yan and Ming are both struggling with their double identity. Yan was starting to lose faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for 10 years; while Ming, on the other hand, becomes more and more used to the life of a righteous police officer and wants to erase his criminal background.\n\nEventually, after the murder of Superintendent Wong by the triad, Ming retrieves Wong&amp;#039;s old phone and makes contact with Yan, and together they foil a triad drug-deal and eventually kill Sam. Everything seems to work according to the plan: Yan could now return to his true identity as a police officer and Ming has successfully erased his criminal connections by eradicating Sam and his gangs. However, back at the police station, Yan discovers Ming was the mole, and leaves immediately. Ming realises what has happened, and erases Yan&amp;#039;s identity from the police computer records. Yan spends an evening with his therapist, who he was falling in love with, and sends a CD to Ming&amp;#039;s wife with a recording that Sam kept between himself and Ming. The two agree to meet on the rooftop of the building where Wong was murdered earlier. Yan manages to disarm Ming and holds a gun to his head. Another police officer arrives on the scene shortly afterwards and threatens Yan.\n\nThe film ends with Yan entering a lift backwards with Ming hostage, when he is suddenly shot in the head and killed by the other police officer as he moved his head from behind Ming. The other police officer reveals that he was also a mole for the triads. He asks Ming for future protection and benefits since he is the only one who knows his true identity. As he and Ming enter the lift going down to the lobby, Ming shoots him dead thus ensuring his identity remains a secret.\n\nThe original ending climaxes with Ming identifying himself to the police as an officer, and paying homage to Yan at his funeral, where he is buried next to Superintendent Wong. A flashback reaffirms the point that Ming wished he had taken a different route in his life.\n\nAn alternate ending of Infernal Affairs was created for mainland China. The alternate ending has Ming exit the lift to be informed that the police force have found evidence that he was a mole. He hands them his badge and is arrested without protest. This ending was meant to please mainland officials by affirming that crime does not pay.\n\n Awards\n\nInfernal Affairs did very well at the 2002 Hong Kong Film Awards, beating the blockbuster Hero for the Best Film award, and also winning the following:\n\n22nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards\n\n    * Best Picture\n    * Best Director - Andrew Lau and Alan Mak\n    * Best Screenplay - Alan Mak and Felix Chong\n    * Best Actor - Tony Leung\n    * Best Supporting Actor - Anthony Wong\n    * Best Editing - Danny Pang and Pang Ching Hei\n    * Best Original Film Song - &quot;Mou Gaan Dou&quot;, sung by Tony Leung and Andy Lau\n    * Nomination - Best Actor (Andy Lau)\n    * Nomination - Best Supporting Actor (Eric Tsang)\n    * Nomination - Best Supporting Actor (Chapman To)\n    * Nomination - Best Cinematography (Andrew Lau, Lai Yiu-Fai)\n    * Nomination - Best Costume Design (Lee Pik-Kwan)\n    * Nomination - Best Action Design (Dion Lam Dik-On)\n    * Nomination - Best Original Score (Chan Kwong-Wing)\n    * Nomination - Best Sound Effects (Tsang King-Cheung)\n    * Nomination - Best Visual Effects\n\n40th Annual Golden Horse Awards\n\n    * Winner - Best Picture\n    * Winner - Best Director (Andrew Lau, Alan Mak)\n    * Winner - Best Actor (Tony Leung)\n    * Winner - Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Wong)\n    * Winner - Best Sound Effects (Tsang King-Cheung)\n    * Winner - Audience Award\n    * Nomination - Best Actor (Andy Lau)\n    * Nomination - Best Original Screenplay (Alan Mak, Felix Chong)\n    * Nomination - Best Editing (Danny Pang Fat, Pang Ching-Hei)\n    * Nomination - Best Cinematography (Andrew Lau, Lai Yiu-Fai)\n    * Nomination - Best Art Direction (Choo Sung Pong, Wong Ching-Ching)\n    * Nomination - Best Action Design (Dion Lam Dik-On)\n\n9th Annual Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards\n\n    * Recommended Film\n    * Best Actor (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang|Anthony Wong)\n\n8th Annual Golden Bauhinia Awards\n\n    * Winner - Best Picture\n    * Winner - Best Director (Andrew Lau, Alan Mak)\n    * Winner - Best Actor (Tony Leung)\n    * Winner - Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Wong)\n    * Winner - Best Screenplay (Alan Mak, Felix Chong)\n\n Adaptations\n\nIn 2003, Brad Pitt&amp;#039;s Plan B Entertainment acquired the rights for a Hollywood remake, titled The Departed, which was directed by Martin Scorsese, and stars Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson, and set in Boston. The Departed was released on October 6, 2006.\n\nThe film was incorrectly identified as being &quot;a Japanese film&quot; during the 79th Academy Awards, during which it won four &quot;Oscars&quot; including Best Picture and Best Director. Martin Scorsese corrected this, calling it a Hong Kong film during his acceptance speech for Best Director. An apology note on behalf of Warner Brothers was also sent to Media Asia the following day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf4fa84ec4c9ab71e385dd120ed1b0c8960df66","amp;dn":"Infernal+Affairs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf4fa84ec4c9ab71e385dd120ed1b0c8960df66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,244,250,132,236,76,154,183,30,56,93,209,32,237,27,12,137,96,223,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
