The murder shocked the boulevard of \n          billion-dollar corporations that help make Akron the Rubber \n          Capital of the World. And the subsequent investigation \n          unearthed an endless list of possible conspirators, almost all \n          of them Dean&amp;#039;s relatives and all of them members of the Akron \n          community.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c0a88faaf6d491cbbd013903b72294da531ef26","amp;dn":"Crime+And+Investigation+Network+Crime+Central+Akron+City+Brother","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c0a88faaf6d491cbbd013903b72294da531ef26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,10,136,250,175,109,73,28,187,208,19,144,59,114,41,77,165,49,239,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
