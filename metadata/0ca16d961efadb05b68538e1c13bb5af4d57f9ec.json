You have to remember I am on a Ship at Sea hading south to Australia as I seed this\nvia the Vsat (TeleNor) network.  It is for this reason your help in seeding is so vital. \n\nBut Queen and Rod Steward fans will be well pleased with the letters Q and R which has everything from the wholesome image of the 1950&amp;#039;s\npiano playing Russ Conway, to the Beautiful whip cracking Ruslana, winning the Eurovision Song contest in the Noughties with &quot;Wild Dances&quot;\n\nI will update The Pirate Bay info file as soon as my link comes back with the track listing of this archive.   Look out for the Oldest recording \nin my collection, lovingly restored by the good old BBC,  Reginauld Dixon&amp;#039;s Instrumental Music Hall hit, &quot;I do Love to Be Beside The Seaside&quot;\nrecorded on Wax back in 1912.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca16d961efadb05b68538e1c13bb5af4d57f9ec","amp;dn":"Alphabet+of+Pop+Parts+16+%26+17%2C+The+Letter%5C%27s+Q+%26+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ca16d961efadb05b68538e1c13bb5af4d57f9ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,161,109,150,30,250,219,5,182,133,56,225,193,59,181,175,77,87,249,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
