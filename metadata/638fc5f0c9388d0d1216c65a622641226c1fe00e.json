DO YOU THINK AV&amp;#039;S LIKE HACK TOOLS ?!\n\nLONGCAT FLOODER SERVER\n======================\nWelcome. This is a program made by Anon, for Anon.\n\nFirst off: If you can&amp;#039;t run this you will need the .NET Framework 2.0,\nyou can get this at www.microsoft.com\n\nWhen running this server you can accept Longcat Flooder clients. (v3.0 and up). \nWhat you can do with this server is set a target:port and a protocol: SYN, UDP, HTTP.\nThen hit &amp;#039;Save&amp;#039;. Now every client that connects to your server will receive those settings. \n\nNow you&amp;#039;re ready to start your flood, click the &quot;Start&quot; button. While you&amp;#039;re running\nthe flood, every client that connects will also start flooding automatically.\n\nThis way you can ask friends to join in on the flood.\n\nTests by the Anonymous Testing Laboratories have shown that for webservers UDP and HTTP (UDP|HTTP)\nflooding works best. In other cases it&amp;#039;s been shown that a combination of SYN and UDP (SYN|UDP)\nworks best to take down a connection.\n\nGo forth, go looooooooooong!\n\nVisit us at EFNET @ #insurgency where all great ideas are designed and developed.\nOr at pWnt @ #raids(= irc://irc.pwnt.cn/raids) for epic lulz raids\n\n\nLONGCAT FLOODER CLIENT (beta)\n======================\nSame as above, except on the receiving end. \nIf you wish to run the flooder without receiving server settings you can just hit Disconnect.\n\n\nSETTINGS EXPLAINED:\n=====================\nIP/Host: \nDNS host or IP address of your target\n\nPort: \nPort you will be aiming at (80 for webservers, 3306 for MySQL, 21 for FTP and 23 for Telnet)\n\nMethod of attack: \nSelect the type of flooding you will be using. If you wish to use more than one\njust select the one that suits your needs. e.g. UDP + HTTP = &quot;UDP|HTTP&quot;. SYN is a TCP based attack.\n\nServerlist:\nAddresses (dns host or IP) of Longcat Flooder Servers where you can get certain settings from.\nThat way you can always setup your own flooding operation yourself. To define more than one server\n(redundancy ftw!) you can add another address or IP and seperate them with a pipe |\ne.g. server1|server2|server3| .... etc.\n\n\nFUTURE RELEASES:\n================\nI&amp;#039;ll try to release newer and more stable versions in the very near future (think weeks not months)\nyou&amp;#039;ll find them at the regular places.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638fc5f0c9388d0d1216c65a622641226c1fe00e","amp;dn":"Longcat+Flooder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638fc5f0c9388d0d1216c65a622641226c1fe00e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,143,197,240,201,56,141,13,18,22,198,90,98,38,65,34,108,31,224,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
