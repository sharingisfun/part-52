It&amp;#039;s of some surprise that it&amp;#039;s finally seen the light of day such were the contractual issues around the film&amp;#039;s ownership. The film&amp;#039;s Polish director, Ulap Wellar, hit financial difficulties because of the number of Trabant cars that were trashed in the complex car chase scenes and had to seek financial backing. Hence the film&amp;#039;s ownership remained embroiled in deadlock until very recently.\n\nIn isolation, many soundtracks can be hit-and-miss affairs. Glimpses of brilliance outweighed by filmic acoustics which become lost without the visuals. &amp;#039;Pulse&amp;#039; is a completely different matter. Though the perfect backdrop to the cut-and-thrust action, as a stand-alone Electronic Music album it is a total masterpiece. Anyone into Arcane&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Way Out&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Hyperbole&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Alterstill&amp;#039; albums will be completely knocked out by the tracks presented here. The DNA of those albums are stamped all over &amp;#039;Pulse&amp;#039;.\n\nThe opener &amp;#039;Hel Bound&amp;#039; creates an ominous tapestry before a totally captivating sequential/percussive rhythm takes centre stage. The guitar synth solos are genius. The whimsical middle-8 at the track&amp;#039;s centre-point is infectious genius the likes of which only Arcane, and Johannes Schmoelling, can create. A phrase here, a chord there. It&amp;#039;s instinctively right. This opener is instinctively brilliant.\n\n&amp;#039;Aftermath&amp;#039; could be &amp;#039;Alterstill Part 6&amp;#039;. It&amp;#039;s totally contemporary with that album, with careful melodics, chugging rhythms, a stripped down air which oozes quality. The percussion that emerges sounds straight off the title track from &amp;#039;Hyperbole&amp;#039;. Brilliant.\n\nA classic digi-stab opens &amp;#039;Slaska Escape&amp;#039; which rides on an insistent rhythm that is embellished by the sort of infectious synth soloing that made &amp;#039;Future Wreck&amp;#039; arguably Arcane&amp;#039;s finest hour. Again, Schmoelling in full-flight-Logos-mode is the over-riding imagery.\n\n&amp;#039;Dobranoc&amp;#039; exudes latent power with synth stabs that transform into a melodic wall of sound, and the drums are just tremendous. Strip the components down and they are relatively repetitive and simplistic. Like any gourmet meal, it&amp;#039;s all about how they are put together. This is genius, can it get any better?\n\nThe answer is yes. For simplistic genius it&amp;#039;s hard to think of anything topping the opening section of &amp;#039;Hymn&amp;#039;. In fact, it&amp;#039;s hard to imagine anything topping the track as a whole. Melody. Sequencing. Infection. Structure. Pace. Mood. Atmosphere. Any aspect you care to choose. This track was the backdrop to the climax of the film. And it was not found wanting. You can literally feel the anguish of the film&amp;#039;s lead character, Lekz Volar, embracing his fallen partner in his dying moment. Cinematic and musical genius. Quite simply a masterpiece.\n\nYet, we are only at this expansive album&amp;#039;s mid point. &amp;#039;Route 216&amp;#039; is a real chugger, beautifully constructed as multiple synth refrains weave in and out of the rhythmic structure which changes pace and mood in classic fashion. Beautifully composed, and featuring the most mesmeric synth soloing.\n\n&amp;#039;Ulica Brzozowa&amp;#039; again builds carefully, in common with all the tracks on this album there is not one superfluous moment, at no point does the standard drop. Subliminally we find ourselves in wall-of-sound power-house territory. The compositional skill almost defies belief.\n\nAt 15.43 &amp;#039;The Kashubian Connection&amp;#039; is the longest track and initially shows Arcane&amp;#039;s ability to construct abstract tapestry with the best of them. Gradually a sequential rhythm emerges backed by a hypnotic guitar line. Classic synth lines the &quot;V man&quot; himself would be proud of permeate the soundstage. Just as you think the track is going to rest on its already impressive laurels it shifts up a gear as the percussion takes centre stage and lush stabbing synths scatter all before it. Then we move into a section akin to &amp;#039;Dystopian Fictions&amp;#039; from &amp;#039;Gather Darkness&amp;#039; as a Logos-style sequences dance around. It&amp;#039;s just fantastic!\n\nIt&amp;#039;s really tough getting to this stage of an album trying to find a different way of describing how good the next track is. &amp;#039;Pulse&amp;#039; doesn&amp;#039;t make it any easier at all. All the elements are there, melody, sequence and percussion formed into an infectious and anthemic wall of sound. Just as you think the album cannot get any better, it does. This track is totally astounding.\n\n&amp;#039;End Titles&amp;#039; is a sumptuous conclusion to the album. Anyone leaving their seat before the end of the credits will have missed another fantastic slab of totally captivating electronic music. Another highpoint in an album littered with them.\n\nArcane have done it again. &amp;#039;Pulse&amp;#039; is up there with &amp;#039;Future Wreck&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Alterstill&amp;#039;. A totally essential purchase.
