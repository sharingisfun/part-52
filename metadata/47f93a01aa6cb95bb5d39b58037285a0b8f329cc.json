The main show is over an hour and a half long.\n\nJimmy plays to over 200,000 fans every year around Britain. Watch this DVD and see what all the fuss is about.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f93a01aa6cb95bb5d39b58037285a0b8f329cc","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Carr+Comedian+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f93a01aa6cb95bb5d39b58037285a0b8f329cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,249,58,1,170,108,185,91,181,211,155,88,3,114,133,160,184,243,41,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
