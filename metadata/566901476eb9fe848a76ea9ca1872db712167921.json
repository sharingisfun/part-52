These are Walt DisneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest attempts at animation. Some are made entirely by Walt himself, like Little Red Riding Hood and the Newman Laugh-O-Grams!!! \n\nThe cartoons were made between 1922 and 1928 (Before Mickey Mouse was created) \nThese are silent Black&amp;White Cartoons. Some of them have some audio included but that is later additions, so you might as well turn the sound off, to really get into the feeling of the era! \n\n\nLaugh-O-Grams: (http://disneyshorts.toonzone.net/years/1922/index.html)\nDisney was doing crude animation for Film Ad, but was frustrated by some of the limitations imposed on him. So, at nighttime in his own garage studio, he began making his own films which he sold to the Newman Theatre Company. And thus the Newman Laugh-O-Grams were born.\n\nIn the beginning, the Laugh-O-Grams were only about a minute long. Titles included &quot;Cleaning Up!!?&quot;, &quot;Kansas City Girls are Rolling Their Own Now&quot;, &quot;Take a Ride Over Kansas City Streets&quot; and &quot;Kansas City's Spring Cleanup.&quot; Disney based his subject matter, and won over the Kansas City audience, on problems and corruption within the local government. Once these proved successful, he moved on to longer shorts, using well-known fairy tales and children's stories as his subjects.\n\nOnly a few of these shorts have survived to the present time. But they made Disney's mark, even if only locally, and started him on his way. \n\nLaugh-O-Gram - Little Red Riding Hood (NTSC VCD).mpg      \nLaugh-O-Gram - The Four Musicians Of Bremen (NTSC VCD).mpg\nLaugh-O-Gram - Puss In Boots (NTSC VCD).mpg               \nLaugh-O-Gram - Cinderella (NTSC VCD).mpg                  \nVarious Newman Laugh-O-Grams (NTSC VCD).mpg               \n\n\nAlice Comedies: (http://disneyshorts.toonzone.net/characters/alice.html)\nAlice, of course, was not an animated character but Julius the Cat was. In fact, Julius may be considered Disney's first regularly recurring animated character. In both attitude and the magical way that he used his body and other objects he mainly resembled another popular animated cat named Felix. The resemblance to Felix is not accidental, but to fair to Disney it was not his idea. The &quot;suggestion&quot; came from Charles B. Mintz who had taken over the management of the Winkler enterprise, since Winkler was the common distributor of both Disney and Pat Sullivan (this shows that the movie industry is, if nothing else, imitative). Julius was always Alice's cat, though and his lifespan did not extend beyond the life of the Alice comedies.\n\nAlice's Wonderland (NTSC VCD).mpg                   \nAlice's Day at Sea (NTSC VCD).mpg                   \nAlice's Spooky Adventure (NTSC VCD).mpg             \nAlice's Fishy Story (NTSC VCD).mpg                  \nAlice and the Dog Catcher (NTSC VCD).mpg            \nAlice Gets in Dutch (NTSC VCD).mpg                  \nAlice and the Three Bears (NTSC VCD).mpg            \nAlice Cans the Cannibals (NTSC VCD).mpg             \nAlice the Toreador (NTSC VCD).mpg                   \nAlice Gets Stung (NTSC VCD).mpg                     \nAlice Solves the Puzzle (NTSC VCD ).mpg             \nAlice's Egg Plant (NTSC VCD).mpg                    \nAlice is Stage Struck (NTSC VCD).mpg                \nAlice the Jail Bird (NTSC VCD).mpg                  \nAlice's Tin Pony (NTSC VCD).mpg                     \nAlice Chops the Suey (NTSC VCD) sf sub.mpg          \nAlice Rattled by Rats (NTSC VCD) .mpg               \nAlice in the Jungle (NTSC VCD).mpg                  \nAlice Loses Out (NTSC VCD).mpg                      \nAlice's Orphan (NTSC VCD).mpg                       \nAlice on the Farm (NTSC VCD).mpg                    \nAlice's Balloon Race (NTSC VCD).mpg                 \nAlice's Little Parade (NTSC VCD).mpg                \nAlice's Mysterious Mystery (NTSC VCD).mpg           \nAlice Picks the Champ (NTSC VCD) - ONLY 2.5 MIN.mpg \nAlice in the Wooly West (NTSC VCD).mpg              \nAlice the Fire Fighter (NTSC VCD).mpg               \nAlice's Circus Daze (NTSC VCD).mpg                  \nAlice the Whaler (NTSC VCD).mpg                     \n\n\nOswald the Lucky Rabbit made by Disney: (http://disneyshorts.toonzone.net/characters/oswald.html)\nOswald, the Lucky Rabbit was created after the end of the Alice series. Carl Laemmle, the head of Universal Studios told Charles Mintz that he wanted a cartoon series featuring a rabbit. Margaret Winkler Mintz suggested Disney for the job, and Disney responded with  the short &quot;Poor Papa.&quot; The cartoon was received very negatively, mostly because of the appearance of Oswald himself. He was more of a scruffy hooligan rather than the pleasing personality that Laemmle wanted. Disney went back to the drawing board and returned with &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot; which presented a more appealing and likable Oswald. Even throughout the series, Oswald's appearance softened. When the Oswald series was taken out of Disney's hands and given to Walter Lantz, the figure changed even more;\n\nOswald - Trolley Troubles (NTSC VCD).mpg           \nOswald - Oh teacher (NTSC VCD).mpg                 \nOswald - The Mechanical Cow (NTSC VCD) .mpg        \nOswald - Great Guns (NTSC VCD) .mpg                \nOswald - The Ocean Hop (NTSC VCD).mpg              \nOswald - Rival Romeos (NTSC VCD).mpg               \nOswald - Bright Lights (NTSC VCD).mpg              \nOswald - Oh, What a Knight (NTSC VCD).mpg          \nOswald - The Fox Chase (NTSC VCD).mpg              \n\n\nOswald the Lucky Rabbit made by Walter Lantz:\nOswald - Yanky Clippers - Lantz (NTSC VCD).mpg     \n\nEducational:\nEducational - Tommy Tucker's Tooth (NTSC VCD).mpg         \nEducational - Clara Cleans Her Teeth (NTSC VCD).mpg\n\n\nThese cartoons have been collected from various sources. The quality varies a lot, from pretty good to awful. This is all of the silent cartoons that I have found. If anyone has other Disney silent cartoons, or any of these cartoons in better quality.
