As the population of suburban sprawl has exploded in the past 50 years, so too the suburban way of life has become embedded in the North American consciousness.\n \nOur North American dependence on petroleum makes us utterly slave to it. We heat our homes with fossil fuels, we eat food grown and transported with the assistance of fossil fuels, we watch televisions and use computers powered with electricity generated by fossil fuels. \n\nFinding other solutions wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be easy because weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve yet to find an energy source as efficient as oil. Hydrogen and ethanol, touted as potential replacements for oil, take more energy to create than they deliver. Hydrogen, after all, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even a form of energy, but a form of energy storage, created with electricity and water. The electricity has to be generated using some form of energy-typically fossil fuels.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f0b33750a3ab576a2f2758504e01427aeef06a","amp;dn":"%5BDOCUMENTARY%5DUnderstanding+Peak+Oil%3A+Suburbia.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f0b33750a3ab576a2f2758504e01427aeef06a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,240,179,55,80,163,171,87,106,47,39,88,80,78,1,66,122,238,240,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
