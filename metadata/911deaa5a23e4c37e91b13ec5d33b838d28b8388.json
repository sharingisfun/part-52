Developed from an earlier first generation jet fighter, the Sea Vixen was a capable carrier-based fleet defence fighter that served into the 1970s.\n\nThe Sea Vixen had a twin-boom tail, as used on the de Havilland Sea Vampire and de Havilland Sea Venom. The Sea Vixen became the first British aircraft to be solely armed with missiles, rockets and bombs. The FAW 1 was armed with four de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles, two Microcell unguided 2-inch (51 mm) rocket packs and had a capacity for four 500 lb (230 kg) bombs or two 1,000 lb bombs. It was powered by two 50.0 kN (11,230 lbf) thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 208 turbojet engines; had a speed of 690 mph (1,110 km/h) and a range of 600 miles (1,000 km).\n\nFound on fs2004info last week\nActivation code include\n\nVive les torrents francophones et m___e aux mangeurs de gouda, au troll et au rosbeefs !\n\nPost a comment if you enjoyed it !\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911deaa5a23e4c37e91b13ec5d33b838d28b8388","amp;dn":"FS2004+FS9%3A+DH+Sea+Vixen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911deaa5a23e4c37e91b13ec5d33b838d28b8388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,29,234,165,162,62,76,55,233,27,19,236,93,51,184,56,210,139,131,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
