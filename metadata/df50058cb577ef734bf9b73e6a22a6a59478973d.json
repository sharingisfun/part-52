The sequel to the popular Bagpipe Documentary as seen on Bravo! Television. They Pipe Among Us Too continues the journey started in They Pipe Among Us, the television documentary that introduced us to the pipers from all walks of life. In They Pipe Among Us Too, we meet an incredible group of geographically, philosophically and professionally diverse pipers. Women, men, young, old, some of Scottish heritage, but with Ukrainians, Norwegians, French, Peruvians and Czechs thrown in. Narrated by Comedian-Bagpiper Johnny Johnson. Very funny and awesome bag piping.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df50058cb577ef734bf9b73e6a22a6a59478973d","amp;dn":"They+Pipe+Among+Us+Too","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df50058cb577ef734bf9b73e6a22a6a59478973d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,80,5,140,181,119,239,115,75,249,183,62,106,34,166,165,148,120,151,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
