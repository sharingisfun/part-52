She talks about \nher search there for a woman she denounced thirty years ago when she was \na Maoist and her discovery of a new China that is rich, powerful, and \nincreasingly ambitious about its global role.\n\nAlthough China is still a one party state, you&amp;#039;d be forgiven if you traveled \nthere and didn&amp;#039;t realize it had ever been run by the Communists.Cities like \nBeijing and Shanghai, in particular, now seem like monuments to \nentrepreneurialism and capitalism.The 2008 Olympics in Beijing next year, is \noften described as China&amp;#039;s giant &quot;coming out party&quot;, a celebration of its \nbooming economy, and its transformation into a modern world power. the \ngovernment there is being very careful that nothing spoil the party. So it \nhasn&amp;#039;t enjoyed international media coverage of the recent scandals over toxic \nChinese exports, like toys, toothpaste and food... about alarming pollution \nin big cities and the criticism over human rights abuses inside the country, \nas well as the propping up of corrupt governments like Sudan, which is \nsupporting genocide in Darfur.\n\nJan Wong knows the good and bad of China. She has lived there through some \nof the toughest times, the Cultural Revolution, the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, \nand she&amp;#039;s also seen the joyous leap in the 1990&amp;#039;s of so many Chinese people \ntoward perhaps the highest living standards in their history. She has recorded \nthis transition in numerous best selling books, always vivid  in their \nanalysis, but also funny and with a nuanced understanding of Chinese society \nas it really is.\n\nBrian was glad to sit down with her recently and hear about her latest \njourney to China last summer and the book she produced. Her quest this time \nwas to find a woman she had gone to school with in Beijing in the 1970&amp;#039;s and \nwhom Wong had, in her youthful ideological fervour, denounced to school \nauthorities because the girl just wanted to see the United States.Jan Wong \nwent back thirty years later to find out what happened to her and see if she \ntoo has shared in the Chinese economic miracle...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
