Now you can enjoy the rants &amp; ravings of your favorite Metalocalyptic foursome, and a couple lines courtesy of Dr. Rockso. I spent 22 long, spun hours ripping audio from [adult swim] Metalocalypse videos and cleaning it up the best I could with free audio mixing software. All in all I rate my voice pack a C+/B- grade, compared to some very poor compilations I&amp;#039;ve gotten from websites.\n\nAll files have been normalized to 100% volume and should be just as loud as the standard worms voices, although some audio may seem a little lower due to differences in pitch. Also, a couple of the wave files are noticeably lower in quality, because I had to manually remove the background sounds/music, which ate away at the vocal audio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62feb8bd5568bd83cee5b4aa299ad8a224f518cf","amp;dn":"Worms+Armageddon+Voice+Pack%3A+Dethklok","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62feb8bd5568bd83cee5b4aa299ad8a224f518cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,254,184,189,85,104,189,131,206,229,180,170,41,154,216,162,36,245,24,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
