Fucking awesome!&quot; Kerrang KKKKK\n\n&quot;These Finns plough a furious furrow of post-hardcore riffery and staccato punk rock tightness... You really should not miss this band.&quot; Drowned In Sound\n\n\nDisco Ensemble surely is a very contemporary product, even though the band saw the light of day somewhere in 1996. Since their conception, the band have evolved with every release and as far as I can tell have really outdone themselves with ÃƒÂ¢??Viper EthicsÃƒÂ¢??. If by any chance you read the review for one of the singles that preceded the release of this album, I might have set you on the wrong foot with comparisons to Korn and Incubus as DEÃƒÂ¢??s debut full-length really hits it off on another vibe altogether.\n\nMagnus Lindberg (whom worked with bands like Refused and Cult Of Luna) succeeded in captivating the essence of the Pori, Finland based band which ensures for a album with a continuous flow of driving rocking songs very comparable to what At The Drive In brings. Disco Ensemble are just one of those bands that are very accessible with guitar and percussion section working in symbiosis to have songs full of shifting moodswings floating your way, while MiikaÃƒÂ¢??s raucous vocals give a very distinct tinge to their songs all the while. The album never relents and has a certain voracity to it, as the music soars along then slows down systematically to build up tension and then comes out with an outpour of awesome hooks. This is a formula that works well throughout and really makes ÃƒÂ¢??Viper EthicsÃƒÂ¢?? one of the most infectious and mind-blowing rock albums I heard in recent times. The guitar-section really adds weight to the album by providing a myriad of colours and flavours, and in general really compliments MiikaÃƒÂ¢??s potent and often aggressively tainted wails that seem to live off his last gasp. It has to be said though that when he goes that deep, he canÃƒÂ¢??t really keep his voice steady enough which makes it sounds like the vocals are out of key but in a weird way this only adds charm to the vocal aspect. This is obvious in songs like ÃƒÂ¢??Skeleton KeyÃƒÂ¢??, that already featured on the single I talked about above. \n\nÃƒÂ¢??Viper EthicsÃƒÂ¢?? is undeniably the bands most focused and well put together effort. The spiky frivolous compositions that constantly shift from this moodset to the next and back, over a set of blissful punchy vocals that skim a multitude of styles make for an album that never lets down and keeps it interesting throughout. Get your groove on and enjoy what FinlandÃƒÂ¢??s finest have to offer! Call this progressive rock or indie-rock, fact is that ÃƒÂ¢??Viper EthicsÃƒÂ¢?? is a classy album. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb64a63025f515945c4b985b5969a70c735c0e87","amp;dn":"Disco+Ensemble+-+Viper+Ethics+%282003%29+%5B320kb%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb64a63025f515945c4b985b5969a70c735c0e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,100,166,48,37,245,21,148,92,75,152,91,89,105,167,12,115,92,14,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
