In the autumn of 2005 I learned how to record on my computer by making thirty songs about cats that were all less than a minute in length. It took me about three weeks.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, I decided to make another one about exotic cats and only came up with six more songs, which i tacked onto the other thirty and released online for free download. This is that version.\n\nSince its release, it has spawned some guys I don&amp;#039;t know to write two other albums called Thirty-Seven Songs About Dogs and Thirty-Eight Songs About Sharks. \n\n\nTHIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE!\nTo visit the collective:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://001collective.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://001collective.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo visit the artist&amp;#039;s myspace:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://myspace.com/tinyfolksings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://myspace.com/tinyfolksings&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e4ab31c847aeca4791c5eecb0f1b2a5762faee","amp;dn":"Tinyfolk+-+Thirty-Six+Cat+Songs+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e4ab31c847aeca4791c5eecb0f1b2a5762faee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,228,171,49,200,71,174,202,71,145,197,238,203,15,27,42,87,98,250,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
