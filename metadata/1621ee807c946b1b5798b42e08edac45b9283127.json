When he punches his Spanish teacher at school, he is sentenced to three months of house-arrest during his vacations. Kale snoops his neighbors with a binoculars and video camera for killing time, and becomes a voyeur of his next door neighbor Ashley Carlson. When Ashley sees Kale and his friend Ronnie at the window, he tells out of the blue that their neighbor Robert Turner seems to be a wanted serial killer from Austin, Texas. The trio sneaks around his house, and Kale begins to suspect that Mr. Turner might really be the murderer.\n\nCover: http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/5696/505436disturbiapostersib4.jpg\n\nIMDB: http://imdb.com/title/tt0486822/\n\n\n100mbps so don&amp;#039;t say anything about the seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1621ee807c946b1b5798b42e08edac45b9283127","amp;dn":"Disturbia.2007.PROPER.MULTiSUBS.PAL.DVDr-DELERiUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1621ee807c946b1b5798b42e08edac45b9283127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,33,238,128,124,148,107,27,87,152,180,46,8,237,172,69,185,40,49,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
