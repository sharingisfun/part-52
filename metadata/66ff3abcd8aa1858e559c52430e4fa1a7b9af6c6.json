On trial for murder, long-missing heiress Catherine Miles narrates an amazing and harrowing tale to reporters about her disappearance. After graduating from her boarding school at the age of 18, Catherine joins her parents in South America for a vacation. But during a trip down the Amazon, their boat is attacked and everyone is brutally slain by natives, except for Catherine. Captured by the tribe, she is subjected to humiliation and torture, managing to survive by adopting the natives&amp;#039; grotesque cannibalistic customs and with the help of one warrior who falls in love with her. The entire time, however, she plots her revenge for the death of her parents. Featuring plenty of nudity and gore to satisfy fans of the subgenre, AMAZONIA is comparable to films like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.\n\n\nlater/FFF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66ff3abcd8aa1858e559c52430e4fa1a7b9af6c6","amp;dn":"The.Catherine.Miles.Story.%281985%29..........FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66ff3abcd8aa1858e559c52430e4fa1a7b9af6c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,255,58,188,216,170,24,88,229,89,197,36,48,228,250,26,123,154,246,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
