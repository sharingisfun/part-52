Joseph Mealey &amp; Michael Shoob\n\n http://www.bushsbrain.com/\n http://imdb.com/title/tt0403910\n \n Political consultant Karl Rove stands accused of\n outing CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose husband Joe\n Wilson had outed Bush &amp; Blair's claims that Saddam\n Hussein had been hunting for Uranium in Niger. This\n piece of tit-for-tat might well end Rove's career,\n which could be not-very-interesting, were it not\n that he is known as 'Bush's brain'.
