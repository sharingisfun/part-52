The bonus track usually found with Reckoning Night downloads isn&amp;#039;t really Wrecking the Sphere. It&amp;#039;s really a &quot;hidden track&quot; called Jam. This is the real Japanese edition bonus track Wrecking the Sphere - a real song with lyrics and meaning.\n\nLyrics:\n\nI see the landscape before me\nSo beautiful it makes me smile\nThose whispering sounds in silence\nReaching for me, trying to warn me... once again\n\nWake up to sense the violence\nRight and wrong, clear and strong\nWhispering sounds in the darkness\n&quot;The time will come to undo what you have done...&quot;\n\n    &quot;What if the seas can&amp;#039;t save you\n    From the fires of this world...\n    You left no trees to keep you\n    on the surface, when the day comes...&quot;\n\n&quot;The push that you gave derailed me\n... on my knees, broken seals\nYour vagary led to the silence...&quot;\n... I can&amp;#039;t hear you.\n\n&quot;Please, cast the die\nPaint the horizon with the right shade of red\nWhen the oceans rise\nMother cleans the slate and the cradle becomes\nyour grave...&quot;\n\n    &quot;What if the seas can&amp;#039;t save you\n    From the fires of this world...\n    You left no trees to keep you\n    on the surface, the oceans rise...&quot;\n\nUnder the sky...\nwe create our future\nTowards the end we tend to forget\nIs world such a bad place\nWhy are we wrecking the sphere...\n\nFour seasons turn into two,\nTwo less seats in the ancient guild\nThe bond is now obsolete...\nYou gave us the roots and the wings,\nthe more you gave, the more we parted from you.\nThis days seems so infinite\nWe never learned to be afraid...\n\nPray no, you should not pray now\nMust believe in yourself\nAll the choices you make\nWill define you in the end\nTruly, we&amp;#039;re a lost cause\nA tiny rhymeless word\nIn the poem of time\n\n    What if the seas can&amp;#039;t save you\n    From the fires of this world...\n    You left no trees to keep you\n    back to surface, when the oceans rise..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1285fcdce17b012538c4c76d78510d05be823776","amp;dn":"Sonata+Arctica+-+Wrecking+the+Sphere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1285fcdce17b012538c4c76d78510d05be823776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,133,252,220,225,123,1,37,56,196,199,109,120,81,13,5,190,130,55,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
