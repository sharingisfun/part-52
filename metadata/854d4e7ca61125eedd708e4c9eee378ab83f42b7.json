Yet.)\n\nOne man will challenge an empire\n\nHow far would you go to become a hero?\n\nOne man&amp;#039;s strength will unite an empire\n\nIn ancient China, before the reign of the first emperor, warring factions throughout the Six Kingdoms plot to assassinate the most powerful ruler, Qin. When a minor official defeats Qin&amp;#039;s three principal enemies, he is summoned to the palace to tell Qin the story of his surprising victory. Written by Yocke\n\nIn ancient times China was divided into seven kingdoms. Qin, the king of the northern province, is under permanent threat of assassination attempts. His greatest fears are the warriors &quot;Broken Sword&quot;, &quot;Flying Snow&quot; and &quot;Sky&quot;. One day one of the magistrates of his kingdom enters the palace, claims that he defeated all three of the emperor&amp;#039;s adversaries and tells his story; how he beat &quot;Sky&quot; in a duel and used the love between &quot;Broken Sword&quot; and &quot;Flying Snow&quot; to subdue them.
