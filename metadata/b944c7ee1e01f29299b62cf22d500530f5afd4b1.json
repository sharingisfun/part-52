Those were the days before mp3s.\n\nSince then times have changed and music distribution has changed, and my life has changed. I am not as active in releasing new music, however I am still quite active in making it, I just never bother to finish anything at the same rate I did when I was younger.\n\nAnyhow, it is time to try out the torrent way of distributing music legally, since I am its author by rights, and see how things go.\n\nJohann Haukur Gunnarsson,\nkjwise,\nIceland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b944c7ee1e01f29299b62cf22d500530f5afd4b1","amp;dn":"kjwise+music+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b944c7ee1e01f29299b62cf22d500530f5afd4b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,68,199,238,30,1,242,146,153,182,44,242,45,80,5,48,245,175,212,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
