Joke\n\nPlot Outline:\nBlue Collar Comedy Tour veterans Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall team up in DELTA FARCE, a military-spoof comedy featuring their southern red-neck stand-up schtick. Bill and Larry, along with their scrawny friend Everett (played by DJ Qualls), are weekend warriors in the Army reserves. Not only have they not trained, but they see the weekend as a getaway from the pressures of their daily lives. But with the militaryÃƒÂ¢??s forces depleted by the no-end-in-sight Iraq War, they turn to their reservists. Bill, Larry, and Everett are thrown into whirlwind boot-camp sessions, led by the commanding powerhouse Sgt. Kilgore (Keith David), to prepare for their upcoming deployment to Iraq. On their overnight flight to the Middle East, a thunderstorm threatens the cargo carrier, and equipment fitted with parachutes is dumped to lighten the load. Unfortunately, this includes the three bumbling friends, who sought refuge in an all-terrain vehicle to catch up on some sleep. They wake up in the desert, confused and disoriented, and assume theyÃƒÂ¢??ve reached the mission destination. But it turns out they arenÃƒÂ¢??t anywhere near Iraq--theyÃƒÂ¢??ve landed in Mexico, where they stumble upon a small village that has been overrun and terrorized by gun-wielding gangsters. \n\nCredited cast:\n\nMichael Edward Rose\t ... \tSgt.
