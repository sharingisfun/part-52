The narrative begins with US forces, after a few months of training in the south, leaving. The northern \n\nleader uses this moment of weakness to attack the rest of the island. The player takes on the role of one soldier in one of the platoons not rotated off the island before the conflict began. The platoons aids the Royal Army Corps of Sahrani (RACS) in fending off the larger and more powerful neighbourÃƒÂ¢??s offensive being spearheaded by the Sahrani Liberation Army (SLA, referred to as &quot;slags&quot; as slang by soldiers in the game).\n\nThe campaign follows a linear storyline. However, each level in the campaign will have a multitude of options for the player on how to progress through the mission. The playerÃƒÂ¢??s in-game performance and choices determine how the storyline progresses and ultimately will have a bearing on the war itself. For example, a mission to seize a crucial town can have a substantial effect on the story depending on the player&amp;#039;s level of success or failure. Failure to successfully complete an objective does not result in the game ending but merely becomes another thread in the tapestry. Hostile squads act independently of the player&amp;#039;s actions so that they may be engaging in an activity dictated by the game AI that does not necessarily involve the player. This implies that the game has high replay value as no two games will be identical.\n\nOnline Game Queen&amp;#039;s Gambit is going to be introduced in September as a followup to the original storyline and will add second event afterward.\n\nThe content of the original OFP game is currently being converted to ArmA format and standards, and will be released, at a yet unspecified date, as a free addon, titled &quot;Cold War Rearmed&quot;. This addon will contain the original islands, models as well as the campaign and missions.\n\n __________________________________________________________________________________\n                                                                            \nINSTALL NOTES:\n \n  ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Mount the image with Daemon Tools 4.08.                                 \n                                                                             \n  ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Install the game.                                                       \n                                                                            \n  ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Use YASU.                                                               \n                                                                             \n  ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Use this Serial: S6C8-92G1N-28G7D-BKB47-DWJG8                           \n \n  ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Play the game!                                                          \n                        \n\nHow to use Y.A.S.U:\n\n ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Go in to the map. \n\n ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Press on the Yasu ikon.\n \n ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ It will came up a small window like say: Would you like to your virtual drive.. just press &quot; YES &quot;\n\n ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Then it will came up a windows to, klick on OK and enjoj the game!\n\n                                                        ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9c827e8f4d85f6cb1d65237b9ba4e13bb59c44","amp;dn":"ArmA.Armed.Assault.DvD-Luma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9c827e8f4d85f6cb1d65237b9ba4e13bb59c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,156,130,126,143,77,133,246,203,29,101,35,123,155,164,225,59,181,156,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
