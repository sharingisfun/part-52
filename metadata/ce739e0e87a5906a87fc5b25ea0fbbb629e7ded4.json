Created and executive-produced by Simmons, the cartoon follows the fish-out-of-water exploits of 12-year-old Willy, whose father is the world-famous rock star Rock Zilla. Willy`s dreams of a normal life free of his father`s celebrity trappings seem to come true when Rock Zilla moves the family to the quiet suburban town of Silent Springs. But with a green-haired father, former-model mother, spoiled older sister, and pet Komodo dragon, Willy soon discovers that blending in won`t be easy. Based on Simmons`s own parenting experiences, MY DAD THE ROCK STAR is a clever and thoroughly unconventional spin on the standard family sitcom that plays out like a cartoon version of THE OSBOURNES (sans foul language).
