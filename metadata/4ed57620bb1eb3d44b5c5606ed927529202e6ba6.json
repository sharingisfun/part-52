The Montefiore currency, though solid, is vulnerable. It is called the Diamond-Franc, because it&amp;#039;s based on Europe&amp;#039;s last and biggest batch of family jewels, which are on display in the casino. The S.I.A. has uncovered an organized plan by enemy agents to steal the Montefiore Crown Jewels, and if they succeed, Montefiore will rapidly sink behind the Iron Curtain. Noah does not want this to happen. Al asks Noah in disbelief, &quot;You want me to prevent stealing?&quot; Noah replies &quot;It takes a thief, to spot a heist!&quot;\n\nStars: Robert Wagner (Alexander Mundy)\nGuest star: Ivan Triesault (Maitre), Francine York (Miss Agnew), Renzo Cesana (Count Eduard deCorvo), Len Birman (Prince Cesare di Montefiore), Peter Mark Richman (Anton Vich), Bern Hoffman (Guard Captain), Alfred Ryder (Hunza Schroeder), Susan Saint James (Charlene &quot;Charlie&quot; Brown), Ron Gans (2nd Guard)\nWriter: Leslie Stevens\nDirector: Leslie Stevens\n\nAired: 16 January 1968\n\nXviD/416x304/29.97fps/43min\nmp3/48kHz/118kbps\n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like to see more! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ed57620bb1eb3d44b5c5606ed927529202e6ba6","amp;dn":"It+Takes+A+Thief+%281968%29+102+Takes+One+To+Know+One+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ed57620bb1eb3d44b5c5606ed927529202e6ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,213,118,32,187,30,179,212,75,92,86,6,237,146,117,41,32,46,107,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
