All male family members suffer from a mysterious disease and are in urgent need of organ transplants. The perfect donor, Tykho Moon, probably has been killed in a fire, but according to rumours he's still alive. Although assassins stalk the family members, the McBees start a hunt for Tykho. Trying to escape the dragnet, Alex, a sculptor, meets Lena, a killer posing as a whore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa71a8713de6755734674392c7704d22f569c239","amp;dn":"Tykho+Moon_Fr.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa71a8713de6755734674392c7704d22f569c239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,113,168,113,61,230,117,87,52,103,67,146,199,112,77,34,245,105,194,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
