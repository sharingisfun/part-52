Melee, live in Tokyo, Japan. Fortunately for fans of Smash Bros. and Nintendo music, Nintendo recorded the concert! The US release came in the form of a Nintendo Power &quot;subscription bonus,&quot; bundled with the January 2003 issue.\n\nThe track listing goes as follows:\n\n01 Planet Corneria [2:05]\n02 Jungle Garden [2:57]\n03 Great Bay Shrine [4:14]\n04 Dr. Mario [4:04]\n05 Original Medley [5:00]\n06 Dream of Fountain [3:35]\n07 Pok&amp;eacute;mon Medley [5:42]\n08 Opening [2:40]\n09 Planet Venom [2:19]\n10 Yoshi's Story [2:43]\n11 Depth of Brinstar [3:41]\n12 Smash Bros. Great Medley [14:18]\n13 Fire Emblem [3:52]\n14 Green Greens [1:53]\n15 Rainbow Cruise [2:49]\n\nEach piece is a spectacular orchestration of famous Nintendo music, each one unique  in execution with haunting instrumental effects. A must for any fan of Super Smash Bros. Melee, of classic Nintendo music, or of just classical music, and still something worth listening to even if you hate all of those!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fef7800f9f6eb5bcaa6080cbd16f40ae85e99a2","amp;dn":"Smashing...Live%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fef7800f9f6eb5bcaa6080cbd16f40ae85e99a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,239,120,0,249,246,235,91,202,166,8,12,189,22,244,10,232,94,153,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
