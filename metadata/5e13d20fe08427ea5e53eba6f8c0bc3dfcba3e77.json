Beginning with the 27-year-old Cobain&amp;#039;s April 1994 suicide, Broomfield traces Cobain&amp;#039;s Aberdeen, Washington, childhood and rise to fame, and the 1992 marriage of Cobain and Love, outlining the drug habits the two shared and exploring various &quot;conspiracy&quot; theories surrounding Cobain&amp;#039;s death. Legal complications yanked this film both from a scheduled December 1997 BBC airing and a showing at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e13d20fe08427ea5e53eba6f8c0bc3dfcba3e77","amp;dn":"Kurt+%26+Courtney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e13d20fe08427ea5e53eba6f8c0bc3dfcba3e77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,19,210,15,224,132,39,234,94,83,235,166,248,192,188,61,252,186,62,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
