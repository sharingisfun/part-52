Because he thought that Teh Mainstream is reaching to grip around \nthe fragile retroneck of chip with it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s claws of consuming that turn \neverything it touches into shit and effectively kill everything \nthe culture stands for.\n\nThis compilation is a reaction to that manifesto. Is chip music and culture\ntruly dead? Is that a good thing? Is Ignatz wrong? Will we be consumed by\nMainstream? How can we defend our-self against the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;threat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719e37227be665825657bec51441b4d91a8bf43f","amp;dn":"dot_manifesto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719e37227be665825657bec51441b4d91a8bf43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,158,55,34,123,230,101,130,86,87,190,197,20,65,180,217,26,139,244,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
