When a sailor is killed in the prostitution district, they scour the area, looking for leads. Their first tip comes from a bag lady who identifies Cat, a man who stars at a show in a nearby sex club, as the one she saw entering the hotel about the same time the sailor was killed. Cat claims he was in the hotel looking for his girlfriend, Jackie. Tubbs convinces Jackie to move out from the apartment she shares with Cat and into a safe house. But when Crockett visits the apartment and sees Jackie's crayon drawings, he realises she is the killer, and races against time to the safe house to warn Tubbs.\n\nDirector: Leon Ichaso\nWriter: Frank Military  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b6f4c8fca72711ac9c17d8fd54474cf0b317c7a","amp;dn":"miami+vice+2x15+little+miss+dangerous","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b6f4c8fca72711ac9c17d8fd54474cf0b317c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,111,76,143,202,114,113,26,201,193,125,143,213,68,116,207,11,49,124,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
