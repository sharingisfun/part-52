This is a simple workaround.\n\nAll you need is included in package. It is not much, a text file that explains how you do it, a registry file and NOD32. Just make sure you follow the instructions by the letter and it works. Takes just a second to do.\n\nThis method should also work with the 64bit version, but I have not tested that and therefore I havent added the 64bit installation file in this package.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343bad275cc88db0962d3c9341bdf0a0ecb3994e","amp;dn":"NOD32+v3.0.551+32bit+edition+-+Fully+working","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343bad275cc88db0962d3c9341bdf0a0ecb3994e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,59,173,39,92,200,141,176,150,45,60,147,65,189,240,160,236,179,153,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
