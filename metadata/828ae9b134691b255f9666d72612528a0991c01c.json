Robert Plant &amp; Alison Krauss - Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us \n                               (Due to the fusion with Alison is this Robert&amp;#039;s most\n                                succesful attempt at &quot;softer&quot; music since his \n                                Honeydrippers)\n2. Joe Henry - Parker&amp;#039;s Mood   (One of the best albums of the year for me)\n3. Fink - If Only              (This is another contender for best album of 2007)\n4. The Weakerthans - Hymn Of The Medical Oddity\n5. Jens Lekman - Sipping On The Sweet Nectar  (Jens at his best. What can you say?)\n6. Marc Broussard - You Met Your Match    (Who said that white men can&amp;#039;t sing R&amp;B?)\n7. John Fogerty - Summer Of Love (You have to give him credit.....please...)\n8. Marc Olson - Tears From Above\n9. Seventeen Evergreen - Lunar One\n10. JosÃƒÂ© Gonzalez - How Low    (Yep, it&amp;#039;s definitely a contender for best album)\n11. Robert Wyatt - Stay Tuned  (Robert has still lost his marbles. But please don&amp;#039;t \n                                help him find them!!)\n12. Chris Robely - Culture Jammer\n13. Foreign Born - Into Your Dream\n14. Georgie James - Need Your Needs\n15. Cut Off Your Hands - You And I\n16. Neil Young - The Way       (It&amp;#039;s good music, but I&amp;#039;ve heard it before, Neil.)\n17. Phonograph - Charles Bircher\n18. West Indian Girl - To Die In L.A.\n19. Something For Rockets - Stuck In Neutral\n20. Gloria Estefan - Caridad   (Yes, it&amp;#039;s Gloria Estefan and I&amp;#039;m not going mental.\n                                This is a great album. It really is!! If you like\n                                Buena Vista Social Club then you will like this ten\n                                times better. You just can&amp;#039;t sit still.)\n21. Roisin Murphy - Overpowered (Difficult to choose from all these good songs...\n                                 because they all more or less sound the same. \n                                 A very good album, but no surprises.)\n\nThat&amp;#039;s it for now. If I feel like it I&amp;#039;ll do another one.\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to check out Shankly!\nBluegamba.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828ae9b134691b255f9666d72612528a0991c01c","amp;dn":"Bluegamba%5C%27s+Choice+No.+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828ae9b134691b255f9666d72612528a0991c01c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,138,233,177,52,105,27,37,95,150,102,215,38,18,82,138,9,145,192,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
