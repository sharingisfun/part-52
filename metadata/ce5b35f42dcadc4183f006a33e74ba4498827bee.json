As Charlie struggles to adapt to Orlean&amp;#039;s best-selling book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;, he writes himself into his own movie. The various stories crash into one another exploding into a wildly imaginative film. ADAPTATION, the year&amp;#039;s most talked about movie, is at once a hilarious drama and moving comedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5b35f42dcadc4183f006a33e74ba4498827bee","amp;dn":"Adaptation%5BEng%5DDvdrip.Dino.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce5b35f42dcadc4183f006a33e74ba4498827bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,91,53,244,45,202,220,65,131,240,6,163,62,116,186,68,152,130,123,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
