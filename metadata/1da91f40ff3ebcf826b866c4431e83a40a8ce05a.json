Alexander is a woman hater, Rachel a 'do-\n       gooder', and the house is an unmitigated mess. Rachel nurses Alexander \n       through his illness, Felix too, when he falls ill. Sara helps cleans his \n       house, and learns that there is more to life than just reading books all \n       the time. \n\n       Through the help of the children and Rachel Lynde, Alexander is no-longer a \n       cranky old man, and somewhat less of a woman-hater. Mrs. Rachel, however, \n       remains a 'do-gooder'.\n\n\n       I All Avonlea Fans!!
