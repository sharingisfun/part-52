Cohen's primary alter-ego is Ali G., who calls himself a &quot;hip-hop journalist&quot;, but who's really a white rapper-wannabe. When Cohen isn't putting Ali G and his &quot;guests&quot; in unusual and often delightfully uncomfortable situations, he's shedding his yellow gangsta track suit attire and slipping into two other memorable characters: Borat, an impossibly naive TV reporter from Kazakhstan, and Bruno, a gay, Austrian fashionista. Each of these characters will be traversing America, exploring different aspects of our culture, and interviewing real celebrities and dignitaries.\n\n-Keep it real\n\nDisc one\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3351385","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edaccb3f958ad9bc715ff600e372ae08598bcc6c","amp;dn":"Da+Ali+G+Show+-+The+Complete+First+Season+DVD+Disc+Two","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edaccb3f958ad9bc715ff600e372ae08598bcc6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,172,203,63,149,138,217,188,113,95,246,0,227,114,174,8,89,139,204,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
