This looks like a nice alternative to the big name FTP programs, but doesn?t seem to have anything most of the other programs have. Give this a try if you are looking for a new FTP client and see if it fits your needs.\n\nWISE-FTP is a powerful FTP client with a user-friendly drag &amp; drop surface. Highlights are the possibility to edit files and folders directly on the FTP server, the simultaneous transfer, the file quick view, the synchronisation of directories and the task planner. Secure file transfer via SFTP and many more features complete a FTP program that leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nProgram Features:\n\n    \n* Connect to any FTP site!\n    \n* Intuitive user interface: Work on remote sites as if they local files and directories, in a Windows Explorer-like environment!\n    \n* Secure authentication and file transfer: Use the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or FTPS (FTP/SSL) protocol for maximum security.\n    \n* Concurrently transfer several files to one or more FTP servers in the background!\n   \n* Integrated HTML editor enables direct editing of files on the remote system: modify HTML or text files directly on the FTP server.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4da97b567cd947b96f841e94a3af2302636f3d","amp;dn":"Acebit+WiSE-FTP+v5.5.4+Cracked-iNViSiBLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4da97b567cd947b96f841e94a3af2302636f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,77,169,123,86,124,217,71,185,111,132,30,148,163,175,35,2,99,111,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
