So if you can tell me what this is for, then kudos to you!\n\nSkySweep Professional is the most sophisticated member of the SkySweeper product family. The Professional versio is targeted toward Government Agencies, Professional Radio Monitoring and the advanced HAM or Utilities SWL. But, the PRO version is still simple enough that a hobbyist looking for a more advanced decoder will be pleased with it?s ease of use and state of the art advanced features.SkySweeper PRO contains all the features of SkySweeper standard, but contains very advanced signal analyzers and decoding tools. There are analyzers for signal and modulation analysis such as a high resolution FFT, modulation speed, signal phase analyzers as well as bit domain analyzers. In addition there are several generic (universal) decoders (FSK, MFSK, MPSK, MSK, PAM and PSK) which are used to decode known/unknown transmissions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecdd75d87a6926a77e618c5a9547fa185441a08e","amp;dn":"SkySweeper+Professional+v5.11-EDGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecdd75d87a6926a77e618c5a9547fa185441a08e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,221,117,216,122,105,38,167,126,97,140,90,149,71,250,24,84,65,160,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
