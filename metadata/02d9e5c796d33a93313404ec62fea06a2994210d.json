But it was not so, a few days later a Russian hacker team called M33 debuted their own custom firmware, which has now superseded Dark _Alex&amp;#039;s OE firmwares as number one. They work very hard on this firmware, and they make no profit from it. So I highly suggest that you visit their page, and make a donation so the M33 team can continue hacking the PSP.\n\nVisit http://www.krizka.net/2007/08/24/upgrade-your-psp-from-oe-firmware-to-352-m33/ for more information on how to use this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d9e5c796d33a93313404ec62fea06a2994210d","amp;dn":"GAME150","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d9e5c796d33a93313404ec62fea06a2994210d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,217,229,199,150,211,58,147,49,52,4,236,98,254,160,106,41,148,33,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
