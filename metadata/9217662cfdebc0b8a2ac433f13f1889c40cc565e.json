Ulla, a translator working on Orwell, suddenly loses her husband, Antek, an attorney. She is possessed by her grief, and Antek continues to appear to her. She seeks to free herself in her work, in her relationship with her son, in sex, and in hypnosis. In a subplot, Ulla refers the wife of one of her husband's clients Darek, a jailed Solidarity strike organizer to Labrador, a world-weary, aging attorney, who works to free Darek by various political manipulations and psychological ploys.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Film polski - Bez konca (Kieslowski, 1985).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 734,494,720 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:43:08\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 512x304 (AR: 1.684)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 851 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.219 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 86 kb/s [1 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n\nEnglish and portuguese subtitles.
