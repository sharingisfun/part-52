That?s where Mailplane comes in to bring them together: Google Mail?s superb SPAM protection, endless storage and global access ? and the friendliness of your Mac.  \n\n\nChanges:\n\n1) Romanian translation: Thanks to Ovi Pascui Mailplane is now fluent in five languages! You can send translation related feedback directly to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d8b7aeb198a8aab1b5b9bbb7b5f6b6bdacf6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n2) Documentation: The welcome screen, and help window now link to some online resources: A getting started screencast, FAQ, and known bugs: http://mailplaneapp.com/info/index.html\n\n3) Feedback window: The feedback now contains a new online news section. It displays known and confirmed bugs, possible workarounds, and if needed other news.\n\n5) Multiple accounts:  Sessions are now better managed, e.g., Mailplane refreshes the session when you switch to another account. If there is no internet connection, or there is a problem authenticating you&amp;#039;ll get the login box with an error message. This prevents infinite &quot;loading...&quot; message. Plus: The &quot;loading...&quot; status sheet has now a &quot;retry&quot; button.\n\n4) Offline indicator preference: When you disconnect from the internet, you&amp;#039;ll get an offline indicator on the right corner of your screen. For some users, it didn&amp;#039;t go away after reconnect. You can now disable the offline indicator in &quot;Advanced&quot; preferences.\n\n5) Window size/position: The size and position of the &quot;separate&quot; window is now correctly remembered.\n\n6) PNG pictures attachments: When you attach a PNG file it will be optimized and resized, but the file type (PNG) is preserved. It used to get converted to JPG.\n\n7) Mailplane showed up as &quot;Mailplane_&quot; in the force quit dialog. It is now correctly displayed as &quot;Mailplane&quot;. This should solve the &quot;double notifier&quot; problem some users reported.\n\nOther Bug fixes:\n- mailto and &quot;Send Link&quot; from browser did wrong decoding\n- When replying some keystrokes got executed instead of entered into the text field\n- Spell Catcher didn&amp;#039;t work. An update to the latest WebKit did solve the problem.\n- Crash when closing separate window immediately after opening\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c1ed2c869a0007dfb139b6f02318529a052fec1","amp;dn":"Mailplane+beta+1.49+-+GMail+on+your+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c1ed2c869a0007dfb139b6f02318529a052fec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,30,210,200,105,160,0,125,251,19,155,111,2,49,133,41,160,82,254,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
