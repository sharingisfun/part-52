The game was developed by Sega&amp;#039;s United Game Artists division, which contained several former members of the disbanded Team Andromeda, the Sega development team behind the Panzer Dragoon series. It was conceptualized and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, when he was still a member of United Game Artists and now being well-known for recent games such as Lumines, Lumines Live! and Meteos. Mizuguchi&amp;#039;s company, Q Entertainment, announced at a pre-show for the 2007 Tokyo Game Show that it would be bringing a high definition version of Rez to the Xbox Live Arcade sometime in 2008.[2][3]\n\nThe game is notable for replacing the typical sound effects found in most rail shooter games with trance music, with sounds and melodies created by the player as they target and destroy foes in the game, leading to a form of synesthesia, enhanced by an optional Trance Vibrator peripheral. Although Rez was critically acclaimed, it did not get much commercial attention in the United States, partly due to its esoteric gameplay experience.\nContents\n    * 1 Story\n    * 2 Gameplay\n    * 3 Trance Vibrator\n    * 4 Music\n    * 5 Reception\n    * 6 Rez HD\n    * 7 References\n    * 8 External links\n\n[edit] Story\n\nThe game is set in futuristic computer &quot;supernetwork&quot; called the K-project where much of the data flow is controlled by an AI named Eden. Eden has become overwhelmed with the amount of knowledge gathered on the network, causing her to doubt her existence and enter a shutdown sequence, which would create catastrophic problems everywhere should she be able to complete this. The player plays the protagonist hacker, logging into the K-project system to reboot Eden while destroying any viruses or firewalls that happen to inhibit progress, and analyzing other sub-areas of the network to gain access to Eden&amp;#039;s location. The K-Project name and much of the game&amp;#039;s visual and synesthesia inspiration comes from the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, whereas the Rez name was inspired by the Underworld track of the same name.[4]\n\n[edit] Gameplay\n\nRez is a rail shooter in which the player takes control of an onscreen avatar travelling along a predetermined path through the computer network. The player cannot affect his or her movement in any way (aside from choosing a few minor branching paths by shooting specific targets in one level). The player targets foes by holding a &quot;lock-on&quot; button while moving an aiming reticule over up to 8 enemies. Once the &quot;lock-on&quot; button is released, the avatar fires shots that home in on each target. Failure to hit an enemy or projectile in time may cause a collision, which reduces the player&amp;#039;s current evolution level by one and changes the avatar&amp;#039;s form. The game is over if the avatar is hit while at its lowest possible level. At higher evolution levels, the avatar appears as a humanoid figure, while it appears as a simple sphere at the lowest level.\n\nSome enemies randomly drop power-up items when destroyed. Two different items enhance the player&amp;#039;s avatar by increasing his/her &quot;evolution bar&quot; by one and three points respectively. Another item enables the player to trigger an &quot;Overdrive&quot;, which releases a continuous shower of shots at all enemies on the screen for a short period of time. In some game modes, score bonus items also appear periodically.\n\nThe game consists of five main areas. The first four are divided into ten sub-sections and conclude with a boss battle. The final area contains a larger number of sections and a boss rush, in which the player must fight variations of the bosses from the first four areas. The player then goes on to the network&amp;#039;s core to restart Eden in a final boss battle.\n\nThe final area features a variable difficulty scale, depending on the player&amp;#039;s performance in the first four areas. According to Sega, this system was employed to make the game more accessible to casual players, while also making it more challenging for experienced players, thus potentially increasing its replay value.[citation needed] In addition, completing all five levels unlocks alternate gameplay modes, color schemes and secret areas.\n\nUnlike most games, Rez contains almost no sound effects or spoken dialogue. Instead, the game is set to trance music, which plays in the background and gradually evolves as the player moves among sections. The music is enhanced by musical effects (such as trills and drums) generated by the player&amp;#039;s actions, enemies and surroundings. Player actions are usually locked to the rhythm of the music, such that shots and hits against enemies occur exactly on each beat (as opposed to occurring in real time). Graphical elements such as the polygons that make up the player&amp;#039;s avatar, as well as background elements, also &quot;beat&quot; in time with the music. In reference to these coordinated effects, Sega focused its marketing of Rez primarily on the game&amp;#039;s qualities of &quot;synesthesia&quot;, the association of different senses and stimuli with one another.\n\n*** Remember to visit dc-scene.net ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70ad2fd72d57643ac860ec0e1881a08df81dc9fd","amp;dn":"REZ+%5Bwww.dc-scene.net%5D.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70ad2fd72d57643ac860ec0e1881a08df81dc9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,173,47,215,45,87,100,58,200,96,236,14,24,129,160,141,248,29,201,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
