The famous master, Ma Hanqing in Beijing, elaborately developed and improved it into a kind of unique quan.  Its movements are active and quick, very changeable; attack and retreat freely and skillfully, with spirit and forms combined.  Each movement is practical, especially elbow techniques, including overlap elbow, stick elbow, hook elbow, block elbow, butt elbow, turning elbow, straight upward elbow, etc.  It is a set of practical pictographic Quan.&quot;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the files:\n\nVCD -&gt; ISObuster -&gt; .mpg\n\nAudio:  \n-Left channel = Chinese \n-Right channel = English (not used very much throughout the video)\n\nSubtitles:\n-None, but...\n-When demonstrating a particular move, the name of the move is shown in Simplified Chinese and English\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI know for a fact that these types of VCDs can be found in DVD stores in your nearest Chinatown.
