They began by playing cover songs of Stratovarius and \nNightwish. In 2005 they released their first album Primal Exhale. After \nsome changes in the line-up - Jarmo Pakkonen (vocals) and Veso Nupponen \n(Guitar) joined the band - Excalion was ready to write the second album: \nWaterlines. \n\nThis album contains eleven songs that vary between power metal and epic \nmetal. Especially Pakkonen makes a huge impression with his powerful \nmetal voice, because whether he sings ballads or fast songs, he has a \ngreat throat. The album starts like a typical metal album with the \nup-tempo ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤The WingmanÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤, a standard melodic power metal song. Next, \nExcalion shows their real power with symphonic power metal songs \nÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Streams of MadnessÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ and ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Soaking GroundÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤, the progressive influenced \n`Ivory Tower\\\\\\&amp;#039;, `I failed for you\\\\\\&amp;#039;, `Between the Lines\\\\\\&amp;#039;, and the power \nballad `Delta Sunrise\\\\\\&amp;#039;. The final song is the Finnish `Yovartio\\\\\\&amp;#039;, a song \nespecially for their Finnish fans. \n\nExcalion is more than a simple copy of Stratovarius or Nightwish. With \nthe progressive and symphonic elements Waterlines makes a great power \nmetal album. Add the really terrific vocals and the crystal clear \nproduction to the songs and you get an album that has to be part of \nevery melodic power metal collection. So, to all melodic power metal \nfans: Check out this album! \n(Ralph) \n\nNFO generated on.....: 1/14/2008 7:34:07 PM\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:747dc0ffa5d52a9146d17abf0cfd33defc763b82","amp;dn":"Excalion+-+Waterlines+%282007%29+Finnish+power%2Fmelodic+metal+full+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"747dc0ffa5d52a9146d17abf0cfd33defc763b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,125,192,255,165,213,42,145,70,209,122,191,12,253,51,222,252,118,59,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
