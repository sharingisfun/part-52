This is in MP3 format and 320kbps.  \n\nDemiricous are a death/thrash metal band out of Indianapolis, Indiana. Within a couple of months of forming, guitarist Ben Parrish (formerly of Upheaval on Willowtip Records) joined the band and they began to take their project more seriously. In 2005, they self-released a demo which caught the attention of Metal Blade.\n\nTheir debut album, One (Hellbound) was recorded and mixed at Planet-Z Studios with Zeuss (Hatebreed, The Red Chord, Shadows Fall) in June 2005 and released later that year. Following this the band set out on a tour with Himsa in late 2006.\n\nIt has also been stated that the bands name, Demiricous, has no significant meaning at all and is just a made up word. The band have already gained a worldwide fanbase with their debut album, and have earned the respect and praise of metal icons Slayer.\n\nTheir follow-up album, Two (Poverty), was released in 2007.\n\nTrack List:\n1) Repentagram \n2) Withdrawal Divine \n3) Vagrant Idol \n4) Beyond Obscene \n5) Perfection and the Infection \n6) Heathen Up (Out for Blood) \n7) Cheat the Leader \n8) Matador \n9) To Serve Is To Destroy \n10) Ironsides \n11) I Am Weapon \n12) Hellraiser\n\nEnjoy and PLEASE SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6bab64e5a79a67b10bd4753627a4ec425c01a4","amp;dn":"Demiricous+-+One+%28Hellbound%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6bab64e5a79a67b10bd4753627a4ec425c01a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,107,171,100,229,167,154,103,177,11,212,117,54,39,164,236,66,92,1,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
