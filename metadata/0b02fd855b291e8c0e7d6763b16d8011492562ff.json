I made a composite video of Proxima and Stealth side by side and you can see the similarities. (PS. Stealth sucks, don't watch it even if you see it free)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b02fd855b291e8c0e7d6763b16d8011492562ff","amp;dn":"proxima-revised.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b02fd855b291e8c0e7d6763b16d8011492562ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,2,253,133,91,41,30,140,14,125,103,99,177,109,128,17,73,37,98,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
