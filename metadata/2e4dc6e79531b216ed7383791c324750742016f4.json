PLEASE UPLOAD THE FULL DVD of RETURN OF THE ONE ARMED SWORDSMAN if you have it and have it in your heart to hook me up with a movie I need. Thanks to all the nice comments I&amp;#039;ve received, and due to demands I&amp;#039;ve ripped them at 25 fps even though I don&amp;#039;t see what everyone complains about the whole Pal to ntsc thing that celestial did. I&amp;#039;m also the same guy who doesn&amp;#039;t care about the butchered 5.1 soundtracks. The only one I&amp;#039;ve noticed with weirdness with The Chinese Boxer, I couldn&amp;#039;t even be bothered to notice during Clan of the White Lotus. So I guess I&amp;#039;m not too picky, but if the 25fps makes the action that much more smooth then I will give it a try. I was just ripping the movies in the fps that the original dvd was in. I didn&amp;#039;t know it&amp;#039;d be worthwhile to change it to 25fps.
