She finds herself pregnant, which throws her plans awry. She bakes phenomenal pies at Joe\\\\\\&amp;#039;s diner, listens to old Joe\\\\\\&amp;#039;s wisdom, tolerates her sour boss Cal, is friends with Dawn and Becky (her fellow waitresses), and finds a mutual attraction with the new doctor in town. As the pregnancy advances, life with Earl seems less tolerable, a way out less clear, and the affair with the doctor complicated by his marriage.
