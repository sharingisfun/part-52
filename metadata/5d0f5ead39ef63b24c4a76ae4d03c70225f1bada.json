My own personal Best Of Prodigy Live 1992-2005 3CD I've made lots of slight cuts to tracks (usually just a second or two) to try to get it to flow as smoothly as possible into each other (Maxim also likes to always remind us that &quot;this will be the last one&quot;lol). I tried to keep similar sounding recordings together as well so that you don't go from one extreme to another. And aside from a few dodgy track changes, for the most part I think you can listen to pretty smoothly given the wide range of sources. Big thanks to Rolmo for helping me cleanup some of the tracks that had a lot of hiss in them. So for some of these tracks, this will be the best recordings of them ever released!\n\n-BigSugar\n\n\nDisc 1: 1992-1995\n01 G-Force - Waterfront 92\n02 Music Reach - OOS Single (cut)\n03 Jericho - OOS Single (cut)\n04 Full Throttle - Universe '93\n05 No Good - Universe '93\n06 The Heat, The Energy - Liverpool 94 (Rolmo Cleanup)\n07 Scienide - Utrect 94 (Rolmo Edit, cut)\n08 Religion - Illford Island 95\n09 Time To Get Funky &amp; Raw - Greece '93\n10 Ska Beats - Glastonbury 95 (Rolmo Cleanup)\n11 The '95 Vibe - The Point, Dublin '95 (cut)\n12 Your Love - Sweden '94\n13 Brown - Sweden '94\n14 Voodoo People - Sweden '94\n15 Poison - Zap Club '94\n16 Speedway - Zap Club '94\n17 Claustrophobic Sting - Zap Club 94\n18 Break &amp; Enter - Zap Club 94\n19 Now Hear Dis - Sweden '94\n20 Gabba - Sweden 94 (cut)\n\nDisc 2: 1995-1998\n01 Wildstyle Intro - Reading '97\n02 Vogue - Athens '95 (Rolmo Cleanup) (cut)\n03 We Eat Rhythm - Bristol '95\n04 Smack My Bitch Up - Pinkpop '96\n05 Voodoo People - Phoenix '96 Day 2 (cut)\n06 Voodoo Beats - Brixton 97 (cut)\n07 Everything I Do Gonh Be Funky Shit - Vienna 97\n08 Their Law - Vienna 97\n09 Their Law/Narayan Beats - Vienna 97\n10 Skylined - Pinkpop 96\n11 Ghost Town - Reading 98\n12 Hip Hop Fill - Brixton 97\n13 Run DMC Intro - Reading 98\n14 Blow Your Mind - Battersea 97\n15 Ride The Rhythm - Battersea 97\n16 Prepare For The Rush - Battersea 97\n17 Poison - Tourhour 96 (Breathe Single)(cut)\n18 Rock N Roll - Pinkpop 96\n19 No Good + Thank You - Pinkpop 96 (cut)\n20 Gabba - Phoenix 96\n21 Full Throttle - London Forum 9\n\nDisc 3: 2001-2005\n01 Army March Intro - Japan 02 (cut)\n02 Trigger - (Rock Oz'Arenas 01?)
