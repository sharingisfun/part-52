The Roman Empire is under threat. A mighty force for almost 500 years, at its height Rome?s power spread from Mesopotamia in the east to the Iberian peninsula in the west, from the Rhine and Danube in the north to Egypt in the south. This story follows the events surrounding the historical capture of Romulus Augustus and his imprisonment on the island of Capri.\n\nOn the eve of the ceremony to crown twelve-year-old Romulus Augustus as the new emperor, the Barbarian general Odoacer arrives in Rome to make a deal with Orestes, patrician and father of the young Caesar. Odoacer makes demands on the power of the Roman Empire, in fair exchange for his decade-long support of the Roman legions in the east. Orestes refuses.\n\nOn the day of the coronation, as the whole of Rome gathers to watch the proceedings, Ambrosinus, the shaman who is a mentor and tutor to Romulus, predicts danger. Orestes is worried for his son?s safety and appoints Aurelius, the tribune of the fourth legion, as his personal guard. That night Aurelius and his legionnaires are confronted by a real danger?Odoacer and his army of Goths have returned to the outskirts of Rome to conquer the city.\n \n\n--- THE DVD ---\n\nSYSTEM: PAL\n\nAUDIO: Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, English Dolby Digital 5.1\n\nSUBTITLES: Spanish\n\nIMAGE: 16:9 / 2.35:1\n\nFORMAT: DVD9 =&gt; DVD5\n\nCOMPRESSION: DVDFAB DECRYPTER + DVDREMAKE PRO + DVDREBUILDER PRO + HC 2 PASS\n\nREBUILDER LOG:\n\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 68,7%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4.926Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.523.922KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 5.025/4.629/4.926 Kbs\n\nSorry, but in Spain this dvd doesn&amp;#039;t bring englis menu.\n\nVisitthe best spanish site for DVD&amp;#039;s\n\nPREMIERE QUORUM TEAM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27a2e4572cb78142b6f3a8221e0a647ac4c21bdb","amp;dn":"THE+LAST+LEGION++-+ENG%2FSPA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27a2e4572cb78142b6f3a8221e0a647ac4c21bdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,162,228,87,44,183,129,66,182,243,168,34,30,10,100,122,196,194,27,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
