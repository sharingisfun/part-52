Mike and his brother George (who co-wrote FLESHAPOIDS), were the godfathers of bargain basement cinema, pioneering a hilariously campy, lurid style between Ed Wood exploitation and Douglas Sirk melodrama.\n\nSet a million years in the future, after &quot;The Great War&quot; has scourged the planet, mankind has forsaken science for self-indulgence in all the carnal pleasures afforded by art, food, and lust. Work is left to a race of enslaved androids. One rebellious male robot (Bob Cowan) tires of pampering his lazy masters, and joins the humans in sin. The future never seemed so ridiculous?\n\nAs a bonus, we present two classic featurettes from the Kuchar catalog. THE SECRET OF WENDEL SAMSON stars Pop artist Red Grooms in a dark, surreal psychodrama of sexual desire and the entanglements of intimacy. THE CRAVEN SLUCK tells a torrid tale of adultery and flying saucers.\n\n&quot;?a living legend in the world of experimental film.&quot; - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times\n\n&quot;George and Mike Kuchar&amp;#039;s films were my first inspiration. George&amp;#039;s Hold Me While I&amp;#039;m Naked, Mike&amp;#039;s Sins Of The Fleshapoids - these were the pivotal films of my youth, bigger influences than Warhol, Kenneth Anger, even The Wizard of Oz.&quot; - Filmmaker John Waters\n\nSpecial Features\n\n* Director&amp;#039;s Commentary\n* Booklet featuring Jack Stevenson&amp;#039;s Interview with Kuchar\n* Upcoming Releases from Other Cinema DVD\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
