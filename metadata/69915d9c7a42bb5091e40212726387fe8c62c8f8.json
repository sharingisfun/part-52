Thompson on the Conan O'Brien show back in 2003. In addition to plugging his new book (Kingdom Of Fear had just been released) he takes Conan shooting and discusses Johnny Depp, being charged with shooting a shotgun at his former assistant, and homemade Nike shoes :)\n\n(Gonzo fans will note that this was around the same time as his titanium hip replacement, he has trouble walking and sitting down without swearing due to the pain.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69915d9c7a42bb5091e40212726387fe8c62c8f8","amp;dn":"Hunter+S.+Thompson+on+Conan+O%5C%27Brien+%28Feb+06%2C+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69915d9c7a42bb5091e40212726387fe8c62c8f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,145,93,156,122,66,187,80,145,228,2,18,114,99,135,254,140,98,200,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
