Arctic Monkeys took that phenomenon to an\n          entirely new level when they sold 110,000 copies\n          of their 2005 debut LP, WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY I AM,\n          THAT&amp;#039;S WHAT I&amp;#039;M NOT, in the first two days of its\n          release. An undeniably accessible (and bankable)\n          mix of Brit Pop, U.K. punk, and hip-hop swagger\n          has led fans and critics to dub them the next\n          Oasis.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e4f1579a48dbae9595feb71074ae84e001b05f2","amp;dn":"Arctic_Monkeys-Teddy_Picker-CDM-2007-NBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e4f1579a48dbae9595feb71074ae84e001b05f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,79,21,121,164,141,186,233,89,95,235,113,7,74,232,78,0,27,5,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
