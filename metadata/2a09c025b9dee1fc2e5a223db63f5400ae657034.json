Whilst they may be fairly insipid sport-centric units obsessed with the corporeal, they do appear relaxed and genuine, and Danquart should be applauded for his ability to extract such authenticity from his subjects.\n\nHowever, the film's real substance comes with its sublime cinematography and in effect its powerful conveyance of a fascinating though somewhat futile struggle between man and man's inadequacies, and, on an overall scale, between man and nature itself. It is noted in the early stages of the film that the tour was created, in a spirit of humanism, to 'ennoble muscles'. This strong assertion is highlighted with utmost success on the power of the visuals alone, with particular unnerving photographic focus on suffering-scarred faces and flesh-ruptured skin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a09c025b9dee1fc2e5a223db63f5400ae657034","amp;dn":"H%C3%83%C2%B6llentour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a09c025b9dee1fc2e5a223db63f5400ae657034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,9,192,37,185,222,225,252,46,90,34,61,182,63,84,0,174,101,112,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
