It turns out he was born with two stomachs that produce enough gas even to fart him into space.\n\nPersonally, I don?t think this is a funny film. But it?s a request, so I made a small DivX from my original Australian dvd I got for present a few years back.\n\nIt?s not a screwball slap-stick comedy, it has more of a matter-of-fact wry smile approach to it, so the format itself resembles any major studio?s well-made sensible family comedy intended for the average viewer, except for the theme.\n\nIt did win the Lucas award in 2002, though.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0283054/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0283054/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861cb21d30260f0463a3053d1a0adce729068e01","amp;dn":"Thunderpants+%28comedy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861cb21d30260f0463a3053d1a0adce729068e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,28,178,29,48,38,15,4,99,163,5,61,26,10,220,231,41,6,142,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
