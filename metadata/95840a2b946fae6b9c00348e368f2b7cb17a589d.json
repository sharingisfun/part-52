Musical pathologists would find gene splices of the Eraserheads, Brand New Heavies, Sergio Mendes and Jamiroquai?s Return of the Space Cowboy CD in their DNA. ~The Manila Times\n\nA wholly independent work, bossaManila is a chronicle of Manila life. It is rife with sentiment, hope, and sorrow. Musically, the groove is ever-present, technically meticulous but raw. From cosmic kismets to generational ties, bossaManila is a Filipino worldview, aiming for global standards in a localized market, where &quot;indie&quot; is a viable alternative, and not a genre. ~Sound.ph\n\n\nGENRE:\nLounge, Indie, OPM Music\n\n\nOFFICIAL SITE:\nhttp://www.sound.ph\n\n\nLYRICS:\nhttp://www.sound.ph/bm.htm\n\n\nSOUND FREEBIES:\nhttp://www.sound.ph/dloads.htm\n\n\nRELATED LINKS:\nhttp://www.rushhourhell.org/archives/00000011.shtml\nhttp://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/jan/20/yehey/enter/20040120ent1.html\n\n\nTORRENT DETAILS:\nMP3 Format\n65mb (12 Files)\n\n\n- Bossa Manila\n- Bossa Reprise\n- Habulan\n- Improvise\n- Loop\n- Persuasion\n- Real Revolution\n- Rebuilding\n- Space Samba\n- Statues\n- Underwater Dub\n- Waves\n\n\nPLEASE READ:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------++\nBe advised that I cannot stay online all the time.\nI may be offline for some hours, so please be patient with the seeding.\n\nPlease help me SEED once you are finished, that'll be nice.\nUpload what you've downloaded at least.
