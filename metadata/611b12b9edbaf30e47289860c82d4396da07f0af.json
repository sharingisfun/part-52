Anyone with more new Velvet Revolver concerts from 2007 please share with the rest of us. Looking for the New York show from this year as well as a non MP3 version of the Buenos Aires show from April 15, 2007. I know they are out there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:611b12b9edbaf30e47289860c82d4396da07f0af","amp;dn":"Velvet+Revolver+Washington+DC+May+15%2C2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"611b12b9edbaf30e47289860c82d4396da07f0af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,27,18,185,237,186,243,14,71,40,152,96,200,45,67,150,218,7,240,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
