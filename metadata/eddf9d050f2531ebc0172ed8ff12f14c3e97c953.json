Set in 1960s Baltimore, the story follows a plump young girl named Tracy Turnblad (played by impressive newcomer Nikki Blonski) on an amazing journey as her dream of dancing on the popular Corny Collins Show becomes a reality. The local television program is a shiny spectacle spear-headed by Corny Collins (James Marsden), a gang of young dancers, and producer Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), a seductress ice queen whose manipulative ways ensure her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow) gets more than her fair share of screen time as one of the shows stars. When Tracy shows up at an open call, Velma can barely contain her rage, and sets out to rid the show of Tracy and the talented black dancers who make up the shows popular, Negro Day.\n\nCast: John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chris Walken, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah.\n\nVideo = (E)\nAudio = (E)\n\n\n\nPlease be Kind and Seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eddf9d050f2531ebc0172ed8ff12f14c3e97c953","amp;dn":"Double+Feature%3A-+Death+at+a+Funeral%2C+Hairspray+RMVB+%5BRpM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eddf9d050f2531ebc0172ed8ff12f14c3e97c953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,223,157,5,15,37,49,235,192,23,46,216,255,18,241,76,62,151,201,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
