It was\nreissued in a more standard packaging in 2000. Customers ordering from our website will still receive the digipak.\n \nThis time they are assisted by cartoonist &amp; designer Joost Swarte, who developed the beautiful CD package. The music is bubbly and danceable, like\nA&amp;C&amp;#039;s previous &quot;Easy Tune&quot; releases but in various styles, such as cha-cha, drum &amp;#039;n bass, and Europop. Chanteuse Fay Lovsky vocalizes in pseudo-French\non Jealousie, and another song features Liesbeth Esselink of Solex. Swarte obtained artistic inspiration from the songs.\n \nArling &amp; Cameron moved to another label (Emperor Norton) in 1999 and continued to produce frothy pop that sounds great both on headphones and on\nthe dance floor.\n\nTracklisting\n\n\nTotal duration 44 minutes\n\n1.
