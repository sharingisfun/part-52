This vinyl version of the album sounds significantly better and has all of the dynamics intact. I have included the four b-sides that were also released on 12&quot; vinyl. All of these records play at 45 RPM for improved fidelity. I think they could have used better vinyl for the album...there is a bit more surface noise than your typical audiophile vinyl...but all in all, this LP sounds great. The b-sides sound even better and they seem to have been pressed on quieter vinyl.\n\nThe records were transferred with an AT-440ML stylus into a Philips standalone CD Recorder and ripped to WAV with EAC. CoolEditPro was used for editing and mastering. EQ and volume were slightly adjusted. Pops and clicks were removed by hand. There was no other processing of any kind.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0f25767c8430dc3467ab188ef85aa6f2a6dbda","amp;dn":"HTTTvinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0f25767c8430dc3467ab188ef85aa6f2a6dbda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,15,37,118,124,132,48,220,52,103,171,24,142,248,90,166,242,166,219,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
