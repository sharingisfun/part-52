Instead of spending frustrating hours learning how to use hundreds of complicated functions you just select a task ? for example ?Burn Files?, ?Backup Files? or ?Burn Movies? ? and then the program guides you through all the necessary steps.\n\nYou just choose your format, select your files and burn your disc. It really is that easy, but easy doesn?t mean you get less functionality: Advanced burning functions are also available for experienced users who want to choose specific file systems or use special boot images.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d137d6a34306069a6cf89303913c1e0dc0be3b44","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+Burning+Studio+v7.10-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d137d6a34306069a6cf89303913c1e0dc0be3b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,55,214,163,67,6,6,154,108,248,147,3,145,60,30,13,192,190,59,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
