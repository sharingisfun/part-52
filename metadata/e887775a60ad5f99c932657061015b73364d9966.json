CBB Special\n\nConceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original: We do not hate Captain Kirk, but he spoiled this movie nevertheless. Although the beginnging is kind of nicely done, it is still not a worthy death for James T., so it had to be deleted. Our plan was to make this the first Next GenerationÃƒÂ¢??s movie, filling all the plot holes between the TV show and the movie ÃƒÂ¢??First COntactÃƒÂ¢??. It was dificult was to make up a story without Kirk that would work, and since we did not want Picard to fight Soren two times with bare hands, the 50 gigawatts force field had to knock him out. Our edition is an improvement over the original, if you like Next Generation and did not like Captain Kirk in this movie. 42 minutes of cut footage is a lot, but for the pace of the movie it was good. See for yourself.\n\nTime needed for the edition\nplanning: about 10 years/ 2 weeks finally\nediting: 3 days\nsound editing: 2 days\ntrailer: 1 day\nDVD layout and features: 2 days\npersons involved: 5\n\n\n\nYou must own the original movie before downloading any FanEdited movie.
