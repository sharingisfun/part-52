You control a squad of mercenaries through a series of objective-based missions. The game is set in the near future and the world is politically fragmented with terrorists organizations and drug barons flourishing. The game employs a money system, you get payments before and after jobs and have to pay for background information and equipment. You view the in-mission arena from an overhead perspective. You control each member of your six or seven man squad individually. Each one has a set number of action points per turn. A large selection of actions are available and each one has a points value. The game&amp;#039;s graphics and control system are good.\n\n\nI seed old games. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a64eebc769141f11f1c2e890c82e542c0627bf7","amp;dn":"Wages_Of_War-MONTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a64eebc769141f11f1c2e890c82e542c0627bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,100,238,188,118,145,65,241,31,28,46,137,12,130,229,66,192,98,123,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
