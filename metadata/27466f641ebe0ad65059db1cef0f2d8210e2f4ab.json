It features The Long Awaited Solo Debut of Marie, The Solo Debut of Jay &amp; The Solo Debut Of Merrill Osmond. There&amp;#039;s something here for everyone. I Even included the very hard to find complete soundtrack of Marie&amp;#039;s Rose Petal Place where she played the voice and sung the character of Rose Petal in the early &amp;#039;80s. This is a nearly complete disography of Marie&amp;#039;s (Her Albums as a duo with Donny are in a separate torrent), including a few tracks from her LP Which Way You Going Billy, that I couldn&amp;#039;t even find a track listing of in her Discography. This torrent takes her from her debut in 1973 Paper Roses LP all the way up to her &amp;#039;90s Best Of Marie Collection. I hope you enjoy all these Marie Osmond songs plus the Merrill &amp; Jay Stuff I threw in as a bonus.  \n\nMy hope is that all you other Osmond fans please seed this to keep it &quot;alive&quot; so others may enjoy listening to these older classics. There&amp;#039;s nothing quite like listening to these oldies but goodies from back in the day. As usual I&amp;#039;ll be keeping track of how this does on the network and hope you other fans give back by seeding this so others can enjoy it also. I mean, after all most of us know how frustrating it can be to want to download something nice and there just isn&amp;#039;t anyone around to help us out. \n\nI am preparing a huge 31 LP/Cd Osmond Brothers torrent that will be a nearly complete discography of the brothers. I am putting the finishing touches on it now, trying to find album covers for the many LP&amp;#039;s that will be included. Exactly when I post it all depends on when I finish finding the covers (I have the entire collection all ready and converted into mp3 files as well as all the files are properly named and organized) as well as depending on how this Marie, Merrill &amp; Jay goes.\n\nAs always I encourage all their fans to continue to buy the newer things they make available to us. Just to show you that I &quot;do&quot; as I encourage others to also, I just purchased the Donny and Marie Tv Show Vol #1 dvd as well as tickets to see Donny and Marie Live in Vegas in July &amp;#039;08, in addition to seeing the others in Branson a couple years ago. So, believe me, I do continue to keep supporting the family by purchasing the newer things as I suggest to all their fans.\n\nI am making these older things available because it is my thought that we might not see a re-release of much of this vinyl onto cds any time soon, if at all. I don&amp;#039;t want to deprive other fans from enjoying listening to these songs on their older LP&amp;#039;s as I have been able to do since I put them into my computer a while back. So, I&amp;#039;m sharing what I do have. I encoded these, cleaned them up as best as I could, etc.\n\nIf some albums aren&amp;#039;t complete, not to worry. I did these years ago, and have the original LP&amp;#039;s that I bought and paid for in storage. If I find the time, any missing tracks and/or other albums I will (again if time permits) inlclude them in a future missing tracks osmond torrent or in the Brothers large torrent I&amp;#039;m completing now when I can find the time free. It all all is dependent on when I can make the time available to re-rip those vinyl LP&amp;#039;s. In the meantime, enjoy another part (should be part 4) of the continuing Osmond torrent series I&amp;#039;m uploading.\n\nOsmondmania\n\nTrack List:\n\nJay Osmond:\n\nIt&amp;#039;s About Time\nReleased 1994\n\n1.
