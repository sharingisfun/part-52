The host is a former US Navy SEAL and he uses easy to understand language. This isn\\&amp;#039;t a show dealing strictly with the US military, but instead it crosses international boundaries while offering a look at truly astonishing weaponry.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/future-weapons/show/65580/summary.html?q=&amp;tag=search_results;title;1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/future-weapons/show/65580/summary.html?q=&amp;tag=search_results;title;1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:190cac3a7c518d3513fbe9d8da473728ea1235ec","amp;dn":"Future+Weapons+season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"190cac3a7c518d3513fbe9d8da473728ea1235ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,12,172,58,124,81,141,53,19,251,233,216,218,71,55,40,234,18,53,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
