Almost every piece was conceived during moments of intense stillness or `magical vacuity'. For this I \n\nacknowledge the influence of the late Austin Osman Spare, whose technique for creating `automatic drawing' has found a \n\nsympathetic resonance in my own work. Of all the music I have made, this is, perhaps, the most personal and yet the \n\nleast demostrative. Attempting nothing and existing purely for itself, it is, nevertheless, a practical music, ideally \n\nsuited to the occultist in search of ritual atmosphere or serene meditation.&quot; - Bill Nelson 1987","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34ec69e78cffd8692e34d3aaaf30be6412383f74","amp;dn":"Bill+Nelson+-+Chance+Encounters+In+The+Garden+Of+Lights-+%281%29+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34ec69e78cffd8692e34d3aaaf30be6412383f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,236,105,231,140,255,216,105,46,52,211,170,175,48,190,100,18,56,63,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
