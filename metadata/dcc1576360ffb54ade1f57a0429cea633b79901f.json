It was originally released in April 2003. It was subsequently presented in the United States as a two-part series by the Discovery Channel and its affiliates.\n\nThe documentary was produced largely by the same team who produced the award-winning documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts, though the original series&amp;#039; director, Tim Haines was not involved. In the previous documentaries, extinct animals were recreated with CGI and animatronics. For Walking with Cavemen, a slightly different approach was taken. While most of the animals depicted were still computer generated or animatronic, the human ancestors were portrayed by actors wearing makeup and prosthetics, giving them a more realistic look and permitting the actors to give the creatures a human quality.\n\nLike its predecessors, Walking with Cavemen is made in the style of a wildlife documentary, featuring a voice-over narrator (Robert Winston in the British release, Alec Baldwin in the North American release) who describes the recreations of the prehistoric past as if they are real. As with the predecessors, this approach necessitated the presentation of speculation as if it is fact, and some of the statements made about the behaviour of the creatures are more open to question than the documentary may indicate.\n\nEach species segment takes the form of a short drama featuring a group of the particular hominid in question going about their daily lives (the search for food, protecting territory, and caring for the sick and injured). The intent is to get the human viewer to feel for the creatures being examined, almost to imagine being one of them (a trait that the documentary links to the modern human brain).\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_Cavemen\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Author/Presenter - Robert Winston\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor Lord Robert Winston was born in 1940 and named Robert Maurice \nWinston. He graduated at London University in 1964 and held junior posts at \nthe London Hospital from that time. In 1970 he joined the Hammersmith Hospital \nas a Registrar and became involved in research and development in \ngynaecological microsurgery. \n\nHe is well known today to audiences throughout the world for his several BBC \ntelevision series, which include The Human Body, Secret Life of Twins and \nSuperhuman, and through which he has shown a great capacity for communicating \noften complex science to a wide public audience. He is Professor of Fertility \nStudies at Imperial College School of Medicine, London University, and is \nworld-renowned as a fertility expert. He also heads the Department of \nReproductive Medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital in London.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Walking with Cavemen - Episode 3: Savage Family\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Africa of two million years ago is a crossroads in human evolution. Half a dozen or more different species of ape-men exist alongside one another. Each of them has exploited the environment in a different way and has developed their own survival strategy . \n\nOne and a half million years ago, a new breed of ape-man walks the land. In southern Africa, Homo ergaster has taken the next step to becoming human. They have long, modern looking noses, which cool air as they breathe. Their hairless bodies, with millions of tiny sweat glands, mean they don&amp;#039;t pant anymore to control their temperature - they sweat. And, above all, they have big brains - nearly two-thirds the size of ours. They are the first ape-men to have our complex understanding of the natural world, and can recognise and follow the footprints left behind by many different animals. They are expert toolmakers and use a highly refined stone hand axe. But the most important things they use are their big brains for understanding others in their group.\n\nErgaster live in large social groups and spend their time getting along with each other. Their society is held together not by a dominant male, but by the bonds of family and friends. For the first time, hunters will bring back meat to people left behind from a hunt, using it to forge alliances and reinforce relationships. Their extraordinary social world has led to a new phenomenon in our human story - couples living together monogamously, at least for a time.\n\nTheir new found social bonds and understanding of the world has equipped them with skills that enable them to move away from their ancestral home in Africa. Over thousands of years they spread throughout the Middle East and Asia, reaching as far as China and are now known in their new Asian home as - Homo erectus. Towards the end of ergaster&amp;#039;s time there is evidence that they learnt to control and work with fire as a weapon, for warmth and as a tool. For the first time in our history the night no longer brought danger, but warmth, security and time for the mind to wander and perhaps time for the mind to change. Fire certainly revolutionised the way our ancestors lived - perhaps it did the same for their thoughts.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther torrents related to my favorite subject; humans and human behaviour:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcc1576360ffb54ade1f57a0429cea633b79901f","amp;dn":"BBC+Walking+With+Cavemen+3+of+4+Robert+Winston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcc1576360ffb54ade1f57a0429cea633b79901f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,193,87,99,96,255,181,74,222,31,87,160,66,156,234,99,59,121,144,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
