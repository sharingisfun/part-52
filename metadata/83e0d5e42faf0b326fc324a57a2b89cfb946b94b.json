Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous start of the twentieth century, the two journalistsÃ‚Â´ on-again off-again romance is punctuated by the outbreak of WWI and the Bolshevik Revolution. LouiseÃ‚Â´s assignment in France at the outbreak of the war puts an end to their affair. John ReedÃ‚Â´s subsequent trip to Russia, and his involvement with the Communist party, rekindles their relationship. When Louise arrives in Petrograd, she finds herself swept up in the euphoria of the Revolution. Reed, however, eventually becomes disillusioned with Communism when he sees his words and intentions augmented and controlled by the growing Soviet propaganda machine..\n\ncast: Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Maureen Stapleton, Edward Herrmann, Jerzy Kosinski, Paul Sorvino, Nicolas Coster \nDirector: Warren Beatty\nwriters:Warren Beatty (screenplay) &amp;Trevor Griffiths \nmusic: Stephen Sondheim\t \t \t \nCinematography:Vittorio Storaro \nlength: 188 min\nRelease Date: 1981\nDistribuidor: Paramount\nDiscs: 2(DVD 9)\nDVD Encoding: 2\nVideo:  Pal. \nAspect Ratio :1.78:1 (AnamÃƒÂ³rfico) (Anamorphic)\nLanguage: Dolby Digital 5.1: English .
