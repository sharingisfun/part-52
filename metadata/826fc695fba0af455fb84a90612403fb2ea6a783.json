This\nis all 91 of the original videos ripped from the VHS tapes.  I apologize for the\noccasional low quality due to the source.\n\nThe Nature Nut series is simply the best nature show in the world.  John Acorn\nuses his intelligence, passion, and humour to explore nature in a way that is \ndelightful and captivating.  Great for kids, university students, and adults, he opens\nthe world of nature to us.  Each episode of the TV series contained a music video,\nwritten and performed by John Acorn and his team, which are at once beautiful,\nhilarious, campy, cute, and ingenious.  Don&amp;#039;t miss this.\n\nThese are the Music Videos only, not the full episodes.  I am also releasing\nthe complete episodes as well so keep your eyes open. \n\nIf you have never seen The Nature Nut, I recommend &quot;Flies of Every Kind&quot;, &quot;Wasps, \nAnts, and Society in General&quot;, &quot;Butterfiles and Flutterbys&quot;, or &quot;Exploring \nMonster Legends&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826fc695fba0af455fb84a90612403fb2ea6a783","amp;dn":"John.Acorn-The.Nature.Nut-The.Complete.Music.Videos.VHSRip.DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826fc695fba0af455fb84a90612403fb2ea6a783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,111,198,149,251,160,175,69,95,184,74,144,97,36,3,251,46,166,167,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
