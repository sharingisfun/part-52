Highlights include breaking bands, Lodger, Sleeping States, Get Him Eat HIm and Brinkman; old favourites, Gary Numan, the Fiery Furnaces, Super Furry Animals and the Happy Mondays; new remixes of Bloc Party (again) and BRMC; and live tracks from Emma Pollock, Low and a couple from Glastonbury - not to mention a 15 minute track from Gorky&amp;#039;s man Euros Childs.
