This is their second (and last) LP as far as I know. A rare LP that fetches a lot of money whenever a copy is up for auction. The group also recorded a selftitled album called Lyd in 1970. An extremely rare recording and you`d have to pay a ridiculous amount of money to get your hands on it. \n\nThis is a fine piece of heavy guitarbased psychedelia from Hollywood 1971. The album is steeped in acid-soaked druggy lyrics and riffs, with a garage kinda feel to it - quite good if you ask me :D \n\nRipped to 192kbs.\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e6023061246486a23f8112ebac86509b34b1309","amp;dn":"Lyd+-+Thorns+%28US+Heavy+Psych+1971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e6023061246486a23f8112ebac86509b34b1309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,96,35,6,18,70,72,106,35,248,17,46,186,200,101,9,179,75,19,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
