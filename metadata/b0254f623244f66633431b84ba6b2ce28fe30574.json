The show brought to the air silly voices, \nearly shades of Python humor, mildly smutty jokes, purposely awful puns (light-heartedly booing a \npurposely bad pun would become as much a part of the show&amp;#039;s audience participation as laughing at \nthe funnier jokes). It was totally anarchic for the times. \n\nThe show shines soley because of the talents of those present. John Cleese would later become one \nof the founding members of Monty Python&amp;#039;s Flying Circus, also famous for the BBC-TV program Fawlty \nTowers, and is undoubtedly one of the best comedy writers and performers ever. Bill Oddie and \nGreame Garden were regular performers on the show, and wrote the scripts with contributions from \nthe others. (Python-to-be Eric Idle is also sometimes mentioned in the writing credits.) Garden and \nOddie along with Tim Brooke-Taylor would later form &amp;#039;The Goodies&amp;#039; for BBC-TV. David Hatch was \nanother regular on the show. He has gone on to become Managing Director of the BBC Network Radio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0254f623244f66633431b84ba6b2ce28fe30574","amp;dn":"Im+Sorry+Ill+Read+That+Again+-+Electric+Time+Trousers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0254f623244f66633431b84ba6b2ce28fe30574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,37,79,98,50,68,246,102,51,67,27,132,186,107,44,226,143,227,5,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
