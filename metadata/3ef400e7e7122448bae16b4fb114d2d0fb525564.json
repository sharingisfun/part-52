Is the Taser stun gun really &quot;safer than Tylenol&quot;, as the company claims?\n\nThe company Taser International vehemently denies there have been deaths related to its use but the evidence is strongly to contrary, especially in the light of last October?s filmed incident of a multiple-tasing and death at Vancouver International Airport.\n\n\nTasers have not been proven to reduce gun usage and their use has become controversial following reports of inappropriate and/or excessively repeated use resulting in injury or death to subjects.\n\nStun gun maker Taser International has announced it will offer police a pump-action Taser shotgun that will allow officers to knock out people from as far as 65 feet away.\n(shunster)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/national/blog/video/crimejust...nning_debate.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/national/blog/video/crimejust...nning_debate.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ef400e7e7122448bae16b4fb114d2d0fb525564","amp;dn":"TASERED%21+%7EA+Stunning+Debate+CBC+NATIONAL+2008+01+30+divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ef400e7e7122448bae16b4fb114d2d0fb525564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,244,0,231,231,18,36,72,186,225,107,79,177,20,210,208,251,82,85,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
