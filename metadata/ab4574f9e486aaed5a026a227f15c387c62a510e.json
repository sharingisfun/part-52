Jude Coyne, an aging rock star, buys himself a dead man&amp;#039;s suit. He acquires it online, lured by the promise that the dead man&amp;#039;s ghost will be included in his purchase. Jude thinks this is a joke, of course. He also assumes the seller is a stranger. We soon discover that he&amp;#039;s wrong on both counts, however, and from this point on the story moves with an exhilarating urgency. Jude wants the ghost gone; the ghost wants Jude dead. We watch, chapter-by-chapter, as they battle for survival. &quot;Watch&quot; is the appropriate word, too, because this is an extremely visual book. Hill&amp;#039;s prose is lean and precise, and he renders Jude&amp;#039;s world with impressive confidence. It feels solid, every detail both correct and fresh. And this physicality provides a firm platform for the book&amp;#039;s otherworldly happenings, which seem all the more frightening for being so securely grounded.\n\nHill has a flawless sense of pacing. His narrative never flags, nor does it ever move so quickly as to outrun itself. And one can sense his literary ambition pushing at the margins of the genre. There are times when his writing, for all its spare efficiency, seems to jump away from him, stopping one small step short of poetry. An e-mail to Jude from the ghost (trust me, it&amp;#039;s not as absurd as it sounds) could even pass for something ee cummings might&amp;#039;ve written, in an especially morbid mood. And toward the end of the book, when Hill describes a trip down death&amp;#039;s &quot;night road&quot; in a &amp;#039;65 Mustang, the passage has a startlingly lyrical beauty.\n\nThe story&amp;#039;s horror ultimately has as much to do with Jude Coyne&amp;#039;s past--his mistakes, abandonments and betrayals--as with anything supernatural. Jude has caused a lot of pain over the years, moving through life with a carelessness that verges on the callous. His battle with the ghost brings this behavior into sharp relief, forcing him to reflect upon his own capacity for cruelty. This dawning self-awareness leavens the book&amp;#039;s bleakness and gore (and it is delightfully gory in places) with an unexpected sweetness. Despite our initial impression, Jude is gradually revealed--both to himself and the reader--as an essentially decent, even kind man. It&amp;#039;s this kindness, this fledgling ability to love and be loved, that will ultimately be of crucial consequence in his death struggle with the ghost. And it&amp;#039;s what makes Hill&amp;#039;s debut not only well-written and terrifying, but also--as it draws to its close--surprisingly moving. So go ahead, take a chance, and open his Heart-Shaped Box. I think you&amp;#039;ll be happy you did. --Scott Smith\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab4574f9e486aaed5a026a227f15c387c62a510e","amp;dn":"Joe+Hill+-+Heart-Shaped+Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab4574f9e486aaed5a026a227f15c387c62a510e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,69,116,249,228,134,170,237,90,2,106,34,127,21,195,135,198,42,81,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
