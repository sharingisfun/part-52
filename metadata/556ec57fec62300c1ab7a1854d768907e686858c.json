This is the \n\nreissued version released in 2000. It contains the bonus track &quot;Eternal Soul \n\nTorture.&quot; The original version was released in 1996. Opeth&amp;#039;s musical genre is most\n\noften classified as &quot;progressive death metal,&quot; although the band has many different \n\ninfluences, such as folk, jazz, and blues which can be heard in their music. Singer \n\nMikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt combines death growls and death metal style vocals with at times\n\nvery melodic singing. In my opinion, he is one of the best vocalists out there \n\ntoday.\n\nI hope you will come to enjoy Opeth as much as I have. The lineup for this album is:\n\n    * Mikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt ? vocals, guitar, acoustic guitar\n    * Peter Lindgren ? guitar, acoustic guitar\n    * Johan DeFarfalla ? bass\n    * Anders Nordin ? drums, percussion\n\nTrack listing is as follows:\n\n   1. &quot;Advent&quot; ? 13:45\n   2. &quot;The Night and the Silent Water&quot; ? 11:00\n   3. &quot;Nectar&quot; ? 10:09\n   4. &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot; ? 20:14\n   5. &quot;To Bid You Farewell&quot; ? 10:57\n   6. &quot;Eternal Soul Torture&quot; ? 8:35\n\nEnjoy this great album and seed for awhile, if you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556ec57fec62300c1ab7a1854d768907e686858c","amp;dn":"Opeth+-+Morningrise+2000+reissue+%28WAV%29.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556ec57fec62300c1ab7a1854d768907e686858c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,110,197,127,236,98,48,12,26,183,161,133,77,118,137,7,230,134,133,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
