Action/Adventure \nAbout this game.............In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry returns for his fifth year of study at Hogwarts and discovers that much of the wizarding community is in denial about the teenager&amp;#039;s recent encounter with the evil Lord Voldemort. The Minister for Magic has decided to teach courses in defensive magic, but this leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves &quot;Dumbledore&amp;#039;s Army&quot;, Harry has taken it upon himself to teach them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.\n\nWith the ability to play multiple characters (including Harry Potter, Dumbledore and Sirius Black) this Harry Potter videogame offers fans the opportunity to wield a wand, explore all around Hogwarts, and experience one of the most exciting and dangerous years in the life of the Boy Who Lived.\n\nAbout this torrent...............
