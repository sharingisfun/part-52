For over 20 years, he has built an extremely strong career solely on the basis of his live comedy shows and has done incredibly well at it. Early on, he marketed himself as the UK comedian who would use as much profanity as possible and make the most controversial, lewd, offensive and outrageous remarks. While that choice closed some doors, audiences loved his off colour, common man approach, and, as the legend goes, Chubby has only to post an announcement of an upcoming live performance and, through word of mouth, audiences come in droves.\n\n\nFile Info :\nFormat               : AVI\nFormat/Info          : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family        : RIFF\nFile size            : 620 MiB\nPlayTime             : 1h 4mn\nBit rate             : 1330 Kbps\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : DivX 4\nCodec/Family         : MPEG-4\nCodec/Info           : Project Mayo DivX 4\nCodec settings/Matri : Default\nPlayTime             : 1h 4mn\nBit rate             : 1189 Kbps\nWidth                : 720 pixels\nHeight               : 576 pixels\nAspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate           : 25.000 fps\nStandard             : PAL\nResolution           : 8 bits\nChroma               : 4:2:0\nInterlacement        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.115\nWriting library      : avc2.0.11.1110\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile        : Joint stereo\nBit rate             : 128 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : CBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\nCoherency/PlayTime   : 10120\n\nEnjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b4465dc695ea777648d5ce9eed59629d970423b","amp;dn":"Roy+Chubby+Brown+-+The+Good%2C+The+Bad+And+The+Fat+B%2Astard+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b4465dc695ea777648d5ce9eed59629d970423b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,68,101,220,105,94,167,119,100,141,92,233,238,213,150,41,217,112,66,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
