Lo Wei turns in an atmospheric film, possibly - in some of its imagery, and in its use of a &amp;#039;family&amp;#039; as the cell which infiltrates Japanese High Command and the upper echelons of Peking government - revealing influences from Communist China. Cheng Pei Pei (from Golden Swallow) builds a character of muted but intense single-mindedness, wit and intelligence. Lo Wei obviously delights in his own role as a particularly unpleasant turncoat commissioner, and (directorically) cannot resist adding his familiar humorous brush-strokes. Nevertheless, the more delicate mood of encroaching horror and staunch resistance dominates the film. \n\nCast: Cheng Pei Pei, Ou Wei, James Tien, Jo Shishido, Lo Wei \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://global.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/code-c/version-all/section-videos/did-106/pid-1004777804/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://global.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/code-c/version-all/section-videos/did-106/pid-1004777804/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
