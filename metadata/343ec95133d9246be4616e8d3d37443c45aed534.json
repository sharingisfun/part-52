In 1999 the ship was discovered by the members of Pro Vrouw Maria, lead by Rauno Koivusaari. A dispute between the discoverers and the authorities was later resolved. The ship was in good condition when it was discovered, but only six objects from the deck of the ship have been salvaged. The cargo holds have not been disturbed, so the condition of any art on board remains unknown. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities is responsible for the ship and all recovery efforts.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343ec95133d9246be4616e8d3d37443c45aed534","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.SeaHunters.Diving.Vrouw.Maria.TVrip%5BXviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343ec95133d9246be4616e8d3d37443c45aed534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,62,201,81,51,217,36,107,228,97,110,141,61,55,68,60,69,174,213,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
