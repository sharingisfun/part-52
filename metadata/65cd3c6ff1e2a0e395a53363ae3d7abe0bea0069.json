And so solo is so awesome! Faster Than Light continues with a more laid back attitude and sugar sweet square-melody that can be dangerously hard to forget. Lola keeps spinning on the theme, but with up-tempo drums that&amp;#039;ll make your body dance! The title-song Cacophonetic will instantly get you hooked with it&amp;#039;s mesmerizing melodies, and who can resist the euro-hoppy The Damage Is Coming?\n\nThis is the kind of album you can play in the background for hours without noticing it, but get really upset when it stops playing. It happened to me several times.\n\nSo, grab this torrent, launch your favorite torrent application and listen to this wonderful album.\n\nAnd seed forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65cd3c6ff1e2a0e395a53363ae3d7abe0bea0069","amp;dn":"%5BChiptorrent%5DMM_vs_FoX_-_Cacaphonetic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65cd3c6ff1e2a0e395a53363ae3d7abe0bea0069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,205,60,111,241,226,160,227,149,165,51,99,174,61,122,190,11,234,0,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
