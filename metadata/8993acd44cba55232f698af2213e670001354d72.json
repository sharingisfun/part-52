The doctors are puzzled by her symptoms. They consider everything from tumors to breast cancer to rabbit fever. When all the treatments fail, House concludes she has African sleeping sickness. However, neither the woman nor her husband could possibly have ever been to Africa. The woman will die without the proper treatment, but neither one will admit to having an affair.\n\nVideo :\n\nXVID 4\n1010 Kbps\n576x320 (16/9)\n25 FPS\n\nAudio :\n\nLanguage : English\nMPEG-1 audio layer 3 (MP3)\n128 Kbps\n48 Hz, 2 canaux\n\nEnjoy !
