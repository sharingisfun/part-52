Constructed from AFVN voice recordings and modern CD rips, and uploaded to Demonoid, by Candledipper:\n\n\nHis description:\n\nI put the CD together a number of years ago to remind me of some of the good times in &amp;#039;67 and &amp;#039;68 in the trenches behind the barbed wire. Even through the censorship and the propaganda the pleasure that came out of the little speakers of the transistor radios were a welcome respite. I share them with you now in hopes that you also will enjoy. \n\nContents:\n\n01 - AFVN - Goooood.mp3\n02 - Temptations - (I Know) I&amp;#039;m Losing You.mp3\n03 - AFVN - Station ID - 1.mp3\n04 - Procol Harem - A Whiter Shade Of Pale.mp3\n05 - Beach Boys - Sloop John B.mp3\n06 - AFVN - Chu Hoi Program.mp3\n07 - Dion - Abraham, Martin &amp; John.mp3\n08 - AFVN - Dawn Busters.mp3\n09 - Spanky And Our Gang - Jet Plane.mp3\n10 - Mamas &amp; The Papas - Dedicated To The One I Love.mp3\n11 - Lovin&amp;#039; Spoonful - Do You Believe In Magic.mp3\n12 - AFVN - Station ID - 2.mp3\n13 - Steppenwolf - Magic Carpet Ride.mp3\n14 - Turtles - Happy Together.mp3\n15 - AFVN - News.mp3\n16 - Scott McKenzie - San Francisco.mp3\n17 - AFVN - Stars &amp; Stripes.mp3\n18 - Strawberry Alarm Clock - Incense &amp; Peppermints.mp3\n19 - Small Faces - Itchycoo Park.mp3\n20 - AFVN - PSAs - 1.mp3\n21 - Doors - Light My Fire.mp3\n22 - Bobbie Gentry - Ode To Billie Joe.mp3\n23 - AFVN - PSAs - 2.mp3\n24 - Four Tops - Reach Out, I&amp;#039;ll Be There.mp3\n25 - Supremes - Reflections.mp3\n26 - AFVN - Station ID - 3.mp3\n27 - Aretha Franklin - Respect.mp3\n28 - Rolling Stones - Ruby Tuesday.mp3\n29 - Donovan - Season Of The Witch.mp3\n30 - Jefferson Airplane - Somebody To Love.mp3\n31 - AFVN - PSA China Beach.mp3\n32 - Chad &amp; Jeremy - A Summer Song.mp3\n33 - Simon &amp; Garfunkel - The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&amp;#039; Groovy).mp3 \n\nMy notes:\n\nI&amp;#039;m uploading it as it came. The original used to fit on a CD, but in uploading one of the files was found to be corrupted and replaced. The result is 82:34. To make it fit on a CD and to make it more reaslistic, I suggest the following:\n\nNormalize the files to equalize the volume.\nRemove the gaps between the tracks to make it more radio-like.\nThe result will be just over 81:30. You can either overburn at this point, or drop a file. I dropped the last, and the result was just under 80:00.\n\nIf you want a more realistic experience, you can use an equalizer to drop out the bass and some mid-range and the high treble, to make it sound like a tinny little transistor radio. If you do that, you&amp;#039;d probably also want to listen to it lying in mud with camo paint on your face. Ah, memories.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ba5cdebde21da548967a398e1fcc71d89c75721","amp;dn":"Various+Airists+-+AFVN+%281967-1968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ba5cdebde21da548967a398e1fcc71d89c75721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,165,205,235,222,33,218,84,137,103,163,152,225,252,199,29,137,199,87,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
