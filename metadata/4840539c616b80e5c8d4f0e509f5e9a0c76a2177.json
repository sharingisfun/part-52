But when one of their targets turns the tables on them, it comes down to the strongest assassin, Azumi, to face an entire army.\n\nOverview:\tIn 19th century war-torn feudal Japan, a master samurai takes on the task of raising ten orphans and training them to be assassins. Their ruthless purpose: to do the bloody work of the state by silencing rebellious warlords. After a decade of inconceivably harsh training and discipline, Azumi and her comrades are ordered to assassinate the powerful warlords Nagamasa Asano and Kiyomasa Kato. But burdened with a cruel assignment that means killing friends and enemies alike, Azumi begins to question herself, her master&amp;#039;s--and her country&amp;#039;s--objectives. Still, Azumi remains determined to see her mission through to the bloody end.\n\nCast: \tYoshio Harada  ||  Tak Sakaguchi  ||  Naoto Takenaka  ||  Masato Ibu  ||  Joe Odagiri  ||  Hideo Sakaki  ||  Aya Ueto  ||  Aya Okamoto  ||  Takatoshi Kaneko  ||  Hiroki Narimiya \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
