SOUR is dedicated to the expansion of the online and offline real world   |  \n|   scenes. With more listeners enjoying what they hear, clubs and venues can |  \n|   only expect MORE people to attend events; DJ&amp;#039;s can only expect MORE       |  \n|   people to pay to see THEM.                                                |  \n|                                                                             |  \n| By accident of today&amp;#039;s current real world distribution arrangements, many   |  \n|   artists will find that SOUR releases IMPROVE their real world sales;      |  \n|  especially for items only on vinyl.
