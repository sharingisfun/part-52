In the words of the executive producers, these are stories of people dealing with traumatic changes, driven by the mystery of what happened and why. Some of them have been affected in mysterious ways, and some will have certain abilities, both good and bad, so part of the drama will be watching them adjust to these changes within themselves.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 4: A school teacher terrifies parents with her supernatural ability to inspire artistic students. Meanwhile, Richard and Lily are confronted by police, and Jordan warns Shawn not to overuse his healing gift. \n\nhttp://www.tv.com/the-4400/show/23350/summary.html\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8633866d3e263c344440d3651159996b5469eefb","amp;dn":"The.4400.S02E04.DSR.XviD-TCM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8633866d3e263c344440d3651159996b5469eefb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,51,134,109,62,38,60,52,68,64,211,101,17,89,153,107,84,105,238,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
