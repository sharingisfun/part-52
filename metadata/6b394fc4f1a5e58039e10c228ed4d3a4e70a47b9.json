Sorry about the whine in the background.  I have no idea how to filter that out despite messing with it forever with Goldwave.  It goes away later.\n\nNotes:\nThis show is called &quot;Ghost to Ghost AM&quot; on Hallowe&amp;#039;en night because the host turns it over to callers with ghost stories.\n\nCommercials, station IDs cut.  Everything else is exactly as it was broadcast.\n\nShare and enjoy.\n\n-bleach0-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b394fc4f1a5e58039e10c228ed4d3a4e70a47b9","amp;dn":"Ghost+to+Ghost+Halloween+2007+ghost+stories+-+art+bell.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b394fc4f1a5e58039e10c228ed4d3a4e70a47b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,57,79,196,241,165,229,128,57,225,12,34,142,212,211,164,231,10,71,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
