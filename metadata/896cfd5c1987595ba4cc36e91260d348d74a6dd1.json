This is the last of my major &quot;songs written about girls and relationships&quot; era. I guess it, along with &quot;36 songs about cats&quot; was the first proper tinyfolk album. \n\n\nTHIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE!\nTo visit the collective:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://001collective.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://001collective.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo visit the artist&amp;#039;s myspace:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://myspace.com/tinyfolksings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://myspace.com/tinyfolksings&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:896cfd5c1987595ba4cc36e91260d348d74a6dd1","amp;dn":"Tinyfolk+-+Love+Doesn%5C%27t+Grow+on+Trees+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"896cfd5c1987595ba4cc36e91260d348d74a6dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,108,253,92,25,135,89,91,164,204,54,233,18,96,211,72,215,74,109,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
