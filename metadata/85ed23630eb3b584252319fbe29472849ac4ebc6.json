Because of a silver strike in a nearby town, all that&amp;#039;s left of the town is a deputy, a one-legged bartender and the senior citizens. They take the deputy&amp;#039;s wife hostage and threaten to burn the town if he does not do what they say. While on his way to do a engineering job, Jas stops in this town and offers to help the deputy and the town.
