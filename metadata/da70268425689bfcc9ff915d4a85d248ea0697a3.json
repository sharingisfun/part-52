American military power could remake the world, and in particular the Middle East as a safer, more democratic place. Four years on and many of the Bush administration&amp;#039;s senior advisers have moved on. Richard Perle was one of them. Does he believe that the age of the Neo-Cons has come to an end? \n\n(Glaringly obvious is Perle?s repeated connecting of 911 as the primary imperative for American action to eliminate Saddam. The interviewer lets this go, we may assume because it is such an apparent defect of logic to waste precious time on, and only if you are dumber than stump would you miss it.
