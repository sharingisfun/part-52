George, an \n\nAfrican monkey, is being raised by the Man in the Yellow Hat. The \n\nMan in the Yellow Hat tries very hard to care for George, however, \n\ncomplications frequently occur, typically George&amp;#039;s naivety and \n\ncuriosity get him and others into trouble.\n\n\n\nThe Man in the Yellow hat is typically able to save the day. On the \n\nrare occasions that things are beyond the Man in the Yellow Hat&amp;#039;s \n\ncontrol, George comes through and rights all wrong (usually George \n\nis the cause of the wrong). In the end, because George is just a \n\nhelpless, innocent little monkey, everyone realizes that he is sorry \n\nfor his actions, and they forgive him for causing trouble.\n\n\n\nFor over sixty years Curious George has been entertaining and \n\neducating young people. The concept of Curious George began as a \n\nseries of children&amp;#039;s books written by Margret and H.A. Rey in 1941. \n\nThe books were immensely popular with children because George \n\npossessed so many child-like characteristics, and the plot was \n\nso basic and innocent.\n\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n                       Encoding Information\n\n=======================================================================\n\n\n\nCodec..............: H.264 CBR  (Mpeg-4)\n\nResolution.........: 320x240 (Standard 4:3)\n\nVideo Bit Stream...: 640kbps\n\nAudio Bit Stream...: 128kbps (64kbps Stereo)\n\n\n\nDetails for the show and episode can be found at TV.com\n\n\n\nTorrents For Additional Seasons and NEW Episodes As They Air Can\n\nBe Found At iPodNova.tv\n\n=======================================================================\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n\n\n\n01 - Curious George Flies a Kite/From Scratch\n\n02 - Curious George&amp;#039;s Home for Pigeons/Out of Order\n\n03 - Zeroes to Donuts/Curious George, Stain Remover\n\n04 - Buoy Wonder/Roller Monkey\n\n05 - Curious George On Time/Curious George&amp;#039;s Bunny Hunt\n\n06 - Curious George Takes a Job/Curious George Takes Another Job\n\n07 - Curious George, Door Monkey/Curious George Goes up the River  \n\n08 - Curious George and the Invisible Sound/Curious George, A Peeling Monkey\n\n09 - Curious George, Dog Counter/Squirrel for a Day\n\n10 - Curious George Discovers the Poles/Curious George Finds his Way\n\n11 - Water to Ducks/Animal Magnetism\n\n12 - Doctor Monkey/Curious George the Architect\n\n13 - Zoo Night/Charkie Escapes\n\n14 - Curious George&amp;#039;s Rocket Ride/Curious George, Station Master\n\n15 - Curious George and the Dam Builders/Curious George&amp;#039;s Low High Score\n\n16 - Curious George Sees Stars/Curious George Gets a Trophy\n\n17 - Curious George Makes a Stand/Curious George Sees the Light\n\n18 - Candy Counter/Curious George,Rescue Monkey\n\n19 - The Truth About George Burgers/Curious George in the Dark\n\n20 - The Clean, Perfect Yellow Hat/Bee is for Bear\n\n21 - Surprise Quints/Muddy Monkey\n\n22 - Curious George Takes a Vacation/Curious George and the one that Got Away\n\n23 - Ski Monkey/George the Grocer\n\n24 - Keep Out Cows/Curious George and the missing piece\n\n25 - Camping with Hundley/Curious George vs. The Turbo Python 3000\n\n26 - Housebound!/Curious George Rides a Bike\n\n27 - The All-Animal Recycled Band/The Times of Sand\n\n28 - The Elephant Upstairs / Being Hundley\n\n29 - George Fixes Betsy&amp;#039;s Wagon/Curious George Takes a Dive\n\n30 - Unbalanced/Curious George vs. Winter  \n\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n                              NOTES\n\n=======================================================================\n\n\n\nProperly Formated, Named, and Tagged as a TV Show for your iPod.\n\nChecked and Verified to load correctly with iTunes.\n\nStandard MP4 Formating, so YES you can watch without an iPod.\n\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n\n\nCheck Our Forums For\n\n# iPod Help and How To Guides.\n\n# Torrent Reseeds\n\n# Program Requests\n\n# Previous Episodes\n\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n\n\nTranscode &amp; Taging By Kronos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aed6c98cb6fa9e971935bb002568748e4975859","amp;dn":"Curious.George.%282006%29.PBS.Season.1.Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aed6c98cb6fa9e971935bb002568748e4975859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,237,108,152,203,111,169,233,113,147,91,176,2,86,135,72,228,151,88,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
