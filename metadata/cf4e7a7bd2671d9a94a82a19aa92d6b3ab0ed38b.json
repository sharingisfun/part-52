Stone cuts a jagged swath through Morrison\\&amp;#039;s life, starting with a childhood memory where Morrison sees an elderly Indian dying by the roadside. It picks up with Morrison\\&amp;#039;s arrival in California and his assimilation into the Venice Beach culture, followed by his film school days at UCLA; his introduction to his girlfriend Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan); his first encounters with Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan); and the origin of The Doors ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ made up of Manzarek, Robby Kreiger (Frank Whaley), and John Densmore (Kevin Dillon). As the fame of The Doors grows, Morrison\\&amp;#039;s obsession with death increases. The band grows weary of Morrison\\&amp;#039;s missed recording sessions and no-shows at concerts. Morrison, meanwhile, sinks deeper into a drug-induced haze, having mystical sexual encounters with Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan), an older rock journalist involved with sadomasochism and witchcraft.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf4e7a7bd2671d9a94a82a19aa92d6b3ab0ed38b","amp;dn":"The.Doors.Special.Edition.2.Disc%5B1991%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5DHQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf4e7a7bd2671d9a94a82a19aa92d6b3ab0ed38b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,78,122,123,210,103,29,154,148,168,42,25,170,146,214,179,171,14,211,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
