My upload speed isnt great so this is going to take at least 4 days to seed, sorry guys. If you havent seen Lost I highly suggest you check it out, one of the best shows Ive ever seen, and here it is Hi Res format. This is actually better quality then the Season 1 DVD that abc will put out, since mpeg2 is limited in resolution. The only way to watch Lost in HD is to download this version and play it on either your computer, htpc, or hd dvix/xvid player (see divx.com for info on where you can get one of these). This will NOT play in a regular divx/xvid player, trust me I have tried it. This will however play on a modified Xbox running Xbox Media Center, this is probably the best and cheapest option.\n\nFiles are 960x580 23fps XVID .AVI (700mb) x 25\n\nSwedish sub .srt files are available for episodes 1-14 only sorry.\n\nEnjoy! -OSA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cbff8ad8f01541b81b908548dfa627abc3150a2","amp;dn":"Lost+Season+1+HR-HDTV+Complete+Episodes+1-25+XVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cbff8ad8f01541b81b908548dfa627abc3150a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,191,248,173,143,1,84,27,129,185,8,84,141,250,98,122,188,49,80,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
