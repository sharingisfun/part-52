Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d85e1c64db169187d78e22c387df0bea44023e6","amp;dn":"Complete+Commodore+Jazz+Vol+3+Discs+11-12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d85e1c64db169187d78e22c387df0bea44023e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,133,225,198,77,177,105,24,125,120,226,44,56,125,240,190,164,64,35,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
