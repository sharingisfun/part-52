It is ripped from vinyl and there are a few scratches so the audio quality is not of the finest but the MUSIC is!!!\n\nIf you wish to discover the REAL Jimmy Shand &amp; His Band then this torrent is for you.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719533d629b30f88b8b605fb68612d6fb201e0ff","amp;dn":"The+Real+Jimmy+Shand+%26+His+Band","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719533d629b30f88b8b605fb68612d6fb201e0ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,149,51,214,41,179,15,136,184,182,5,251,104,97,45,111,178,1,224,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
