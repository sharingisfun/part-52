He&amp;#039;s a very talented, yet mysterious computer programmer. Because of his incredible abilities, he&amp;#039;s contacted by several individuals (curiously, all of them are very similar persons named Akizuki Kaoru) to do all sorts of strange computer-related hacking/security jobs. He&amp;#039;s a very quiet guy who lives alone in a small apartment near his niece&amp;#039;s house. At first, the episodes revolved around some freelance jobs that highlighted his abilities - however, later on in the series, characters came back and offered help or plot twists. The school that Shirase had gone to had been hinted throughout the series, and it finally made an appearance in the last episode, when some of the characters began to show their hidden relationships to the others. However, the series was not continued.\n\n\nALL EPISODES + POLISH SUBTITLES.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f243bb991f5c9bab006a9a16ea89c05b4c4b09f","amp;dn":"BPS%5BJAP%5D%5BENG+hardsub%5D%2B%5BPL+sub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f243bb991f5c9bab006a9a16ea89c05b4c4b09f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,36,59,185,145,245,201,186,176,6,169,161,110,168,156,5,180,196,176,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
