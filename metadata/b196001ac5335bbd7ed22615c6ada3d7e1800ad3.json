So about this torrent. It was up to date when I uploaded it; that was almost FOUR YEARS AGO. This predates not only Mirror Moon's translations but also all the more recent versions of the game that have been released since (and there have been a few)! If you're looking for something more recent, you do not want this. I'll leave it up as an archival thing but don't go into this expecting the most recent version of Melty Blood, or even anything remotely user-friendly. Download if you like, but be aware of what you're getting! Thanks. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b196001ac5335bbd7ed22615c6ada3d7e1800ad3","amp;dn":"Melty+Blood+Final+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b196001ac5335bbd7ed22615c6ada3d7e1800ad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,150,0,26,197,51,91,189,126,210,38,21,198,173,163,215,225,128,10,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
