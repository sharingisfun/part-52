The set captures the group at their best -- a time when they were still working with Trevor Horn, and managing to come up with creatively funky and sonically mindblowing numbers that fused hip hop production, electronics, and some of the chunkier pop work that Horn had been doing with bigger groups at the time. The book-like package features 36 pages of notes on the work, with track by track commentary from all original group members -- and the 56 tracks include &quot;Once Upon A Lime&quot;, &quot;War (demo 2)&quot;, &quot;Confession&quot;, &quot;Who&amp;#039;s Afraid Of Scale&quot;, &quot;Moments In Love (12&quot; b side idea)&quot;, &quot;Tears Out Of A Stone&quot;, &quot;Samba #2&quot;, &quot;Fairlight In The Being&quot;, &quot;The Chain Of Chance&quot;, &quot;Close (To Being Compiled)&quot;, &quot;Focus Of Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;It Stopped&quot;, &quot;The Uncertainty Of Syrup&quot;, &quot;The Long Hello&quot;, &quot;The Vacuum Divine&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Art Of Noise&quot;, &quot;The Army Now&quot;, &quot;That Was Close&quot;, &quot;Love Beat&quot;, and &quot;A Time To Hear (Who&amp;#039;s Listening)&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002c52ea62ead4f61eb8ca7975feaf43e55f56cf","amp;dn":"the+art+of+noise+-and+what+have+you+done+with+my+body%2C+god+4cd+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002c52ea62ead4f61eb8ca7975feaf43e55f56cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,44,82,234,98,234,212,246,30,184,202,121,117,254,175,67,229,95,86,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
