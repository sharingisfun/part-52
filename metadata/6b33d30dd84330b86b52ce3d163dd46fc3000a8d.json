A Blake Edwards production.\n\nNothing has been cut from it, all original menus, languages, special features.\n\nWide screen version\n\nSynopsis: &lt;right from the back of the dvd&gt;\n\nFelix Farmer (Richard Mulligan) latest movie flops - and lots of Hollywood types spring into action.  Agents are called.  Lawyers are retained.  Statements are issued.  It&amp;#039;s what master comedy Black Edwards calls &quot;Standard Operating Bull,&quot; the subject of his gleefully satiric S.O.B.\n\nJulie Andrews is a wholesome superstar about to alter her image....radically.  Aiding and abetting the madness are William Holden, Robert Preston, Robert Vaughn, Shelley Winters, Loretta Swit, and more.  Dialogue crackles like fat in a fire, gags range from dead-on deadpan to cormedic broadsides, insights brilstle and sting.  Nothing standard here:  S.O.B. is extraordinary.\n\n\nThis is my first attempt to uploading anything on the bit torrents, so please don&amp;#039;t judge me to harshly!  :)  Any helpful feedback would be greatly appreciated!  Hope you all enjoy this old classic movie....1981 release! :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b33d30dd84330b86b52ce3d163dd46fc3000a8d","amp;dn":"SOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b33d30dd84330b86b52ce3d163dd46fc3000a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,51,211,13,216,67,48,184,107,82,206,61,22,61,212,111,195,0,10,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
