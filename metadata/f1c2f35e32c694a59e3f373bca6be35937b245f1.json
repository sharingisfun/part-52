Stockhausen approached this task with a concept which was to let different instrumental colours merge into one another in a continuous sound-metamorphosis; there was to be a constant ?lightening? of the sound: sombre noises at the beginning of the piece, and light, ethereal sounds at the end.\nContent:\nKONTAKTE f&amp;uuml;r elektronische Kl&amp;auml;nge, Klavier und Schlagzeug\n\nWERGO WER 6009-2\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1c2f35e32c694a59e3f373bca6be35937b245f1","amp;dn":"Karlheinz+Stockhausen+-+KONTAKTE+for+electronic+sounds%2C+piano+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1c2f35e32c694a59e3f373bca6be35937b245f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,194,243,94,50,198,148,165,158,63,55,59,202,107,227,89,55,178,69,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
