The three operational modes are:\n\n- Normal mode: Provides unobtrusive protection for everyday use without requiring an understanding of firewall technology or complex configuration.\n- Advanced mode: Provides power users with an interface for firewall customization.\n- Policy-based: Allows the administrator to set and deliver a customized policy configuration for the firewall (Only available in the Business Edition).\n\nAll modes provide protocol filtering and intrusion detection.\n\nA powerful feature of ESET Smart Security&amp;#039;s Personal firewall is the ability to mark specific programs as being network-aware, in addition to web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. Using this feature, it is possible to identify and mark an application which can be used over a network (such as Microsoft Word) for far more rigorous heuristic checking of any network connections used by the application.\n\n&gt;&gt; ESET Smart Security Antispam\n\nThe Antispam feature provides a highly reliable defense against annoying spam, as well as protection against email-borne threats that share many traits with normal spam. Antispam utilizes both client- and server-based rules to provide up-to-the-minute spam prevention not attainable by other solutions requiring a continuous stream of downloads for detection.\n\nESET Smart Security Business Edition\n\nThe Business Edition of ESET Smart Security includes all the features and benefits described above, but has additional functionality and flexibility that every growing business requires:\n\n&gt;&gt; Server Installation: ESET Smart Security Business Edition may be installed on servers as well as workstations (the Home Edition can only be installed on workstations). This is a critical feature for the competitive business as servers are just as vulnerable to attack as workstations. Should your servers be unprotected, one virus can take down your entire system.\n&gt;&gt; Remote Administration: Monitor and administer your security solution from anywhere in the world with the ESET Remote Administrator. This is an absolutely necessary feature for the business with more than one location, or the systems administrator who works remotely or travels.\n&gt;&gt; ?Mirror? Capability: ESET?s mirror functionality enables your IT administrator to conserve bandwidth by creating a ?mirror? of protected workstations, and pushing updates independently. This prevents each employee from having to access the Internet for updates, which not only conserves resources, but also reduces overall susceptibility to threats.\n\nIncluded Documentation\nProduct Quick-Start Guide (PDF for download; printed manual for boxed version)\nIntegrated online help (accessible via the F1 key) \n\nSystem Requirements\nProcessors supported:\n- 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) IntelÃ‚Â®, AMDÃ‚Â® or 100% compatible\nOperating Systems: \n- Microsoft WindowsÃ‚Â® 2000 \n- Microsoft Windows XP (32 and 64-bit editions) \n- Microsoft Windows VistaÃ‚Â® (32 and 64-bit editions)\nMemory: 35 - 40 MB, on average\nDisk Space (download): 18 MB\nDisk Space (installation): 40 MB\n\nhave fun and enjoy The Joker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18c5e2f5f8228442b9139a3dd5b7c77d9eaaf7f","amp;dn":"ESET+Smart+Security+v3.0.621.0+Business+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18c5e2f5f8228442b9139a3dd5b7c77d9eaaf7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,140,94,47,95,130,40,68,43,145,57,163,221,91,124,119,217,234,175,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
