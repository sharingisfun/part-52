In the first set, Bobby Parker takes the stage to offer eleven soul-stirring blues classics including &quot;Straight Up No Chaser&quot;, &quot;I Ain&amp;#039;t Superstitious&quot;, and &quot;Going Down Slow&quot;. A ten-song set by Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; \nBrown finds the renowned Texas blues master igniting the stage with such classic songs as &quot;Strange Things Happen&quot; and &quot;Grape Jelly&quot; before the night winds to a rousing close with a ten-song Buddy Guy set highlighted by such tunes as &quot;Done \nGot Old&quot;, &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, and &quot;Drowning on Dry Land&quot;. Additional guest appearances by both Santana and Chic icon Nile Rodgers, this is one night of music that blues fans will want to revisit time and again. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie \nGuide \n\nDisc #1 -- Carlos Santana Presents Blues at Montreux 2004: Bobby Parker\nPlay\nSong Selection\nAudio Options\nPCM Stereo\nDolby Digital 5.1\nDTS Digital Surround Sound\n\nspecs:\nDVD9 to DVD5 - PAL - 16:9\nDVDecrypter-DVDRebuilder-HC2\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 77,8%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4.635Kbs\n- Space for Video : 2.397.168KB\nDVD &quot;VOB&quot; format\nSys Bitrate: 10080 kb/s VBR\nAudio:\nAC3 - 48000Hz - 448kb/s 6 channels\nDTS - 48000Hz - 768kb/s clr\nLCPM - 48000Hz - 768 kb/s clr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093d41cf0588786cc9a30d209f1966c9ddda6cab","amp;dn":"Bobby+Parker+%28Blues+at+Montreux+2004+-+PAL+-+DVD1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093d41cf0588786cc9a30d209f1966c9ddda6cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,61,65,207,5,136,120,108,201,163,13,32,159,25,102,201,221,218,108,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
