Get ready for those outrageous Bundys in MARRIEDÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦WITH CHILDREN: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, featuring all 13 hilarious episodes from the showÃƒÂ¢??s groundbreaking debut season, introducing everybodyÃƒÂ¢??s favorite dysfunctional household. This taboo-shattering hit series was often deemed too hot for TV, bringing a blue-collar brand of raunchy humor to AmericaÃƒÂ¢??s idyllic ÃƒÂ¢??80s TV family, where father definitely doesnÃƒÂ¢??t know best! Remastered and available on DVD for the first time ever, this collectorÃƒÂ¢??s favorite lets you get reacquainted with this middle-class clan of lovable losers ÃƒÂ¢?? hard-working lug Al (Ed OÃƒÂ¢??Neill), his couch-potato wife Peg (Katey Sagal), sexy teen daughter Kelly (Christina Applegate), hopelessly horny son Bud (David Faustino), and prudish neighbors Marcy and Steve (Amanda Bearse, David Garrison) ÃƒÂ¢?? as they try to get along without getting on each otherÃƒÂ¢??s nerves! For better or worse, the Bundys may be broke, but this is one family thatÃƒÂ¢??s rich in delightfully demented attitude, wild characters, and racy humor!..\n\nFull DVD9\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5777e1fc208c8382ad7ff7d3498cd6a575134fdd","amp;dn":"Married+with+Children+Season+2+DVD+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5777e1fc208c8382ad7ff7d3498cd6a575134fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,119,225,252,32,140,131,130,173,127,247,211,73,140,214,165,117,19,79,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
