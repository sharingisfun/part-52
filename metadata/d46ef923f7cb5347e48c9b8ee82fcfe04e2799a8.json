Rarely seen and never caught, Garrett is the best that ever was.  Able to sneak past any guard, pick any lock, and break into the most ingeniously secured residences, Garrett wants nothing more than to pursue his trade.  But things never work out that way. \n\n Features  \n \n \n\nTension-fueled Stealth: Hide in the shadows, sneak past the guards, or ambush them from the darkness!\n\nAction Gameplay: Breaking and Entering, Stealing, Sabotage, Evasion, Espionage, Combat, Assassination, and Setting up ambushes.\n\nDynamic Lighting and Shadow System: Every character and object casts a real shadow that dynamically affects stealth gameplay.  \n\nHuge Arsenal of Thieves? Tools: Including lock picks, a blackjack, arrows with numerous purposes, wall climbing gloves, oil flasks, flash bombs, and a dagger.\n\nLeave No Trace: Lure enemies into traps you set, strike from the dark, and hide their body to give no evidence for alarm.\n\nPlay in 1st or 3rd person modes, switch on the fly at any time.\n \n \n \n Exclusive Tip  \n \n \nLooking for a little extra loot in Thief: Deadly Shadows? Why not let yourself get caught? The first time the city guards nab you, they won?t kill you?they?ll just toss you in the clink. Escaping from prison gives you the chance to rob the joint as well, and you?d be surprised how much loot is sitting around in that deep, dark dock. You only go to jail once, though. After you break out, the guards will kill you, so watch yourself.\n\n \n  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d46ef923f7cb5347e48c9b8ee82fcfe04e2799a8","amp;dn":"Xbox+-+RLT+-+Thief+Deadly+Shadows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d46ef923f7cb5347e48c9b8ee82fcfe04e2799a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,110,249,35,247,203,83,71,228,140,155,142,232,47,207,224,78,39,153,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
