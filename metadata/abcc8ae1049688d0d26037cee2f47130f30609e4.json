So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.\nI like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. \nTill now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more \nhave managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.\nRemember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.\nThe date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. \nThe creation may take from just one day to many months.\n\nA few words about MIXAMIX 20070727\n\n\tDear friends. At last it&amp;#039;s time for my summer vacations! I am leaving for\n\tthe beautiful Chalkidiki in Greek Macedonia to spend some days as close by the sea as possible.\n\tThe journey takes more than 6 hours so I sould create something new for accompany these long hours on the wheel.\n\tAlso my friens also were waiting for something new to hear from me so they gave me a great motive!\n\tSo here it is my new mix.
