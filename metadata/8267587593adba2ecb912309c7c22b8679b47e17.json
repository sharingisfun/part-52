Soon after 9/11, it became clear that a global \nenemy could only be countered by a global response. That would mean \nunparalleled international co-operation and, critically, the sharing \nof intelligence between governments and counter-terrorism agencies.\nThis series focuses on the response of the United States, Western \nEurope and South East Asia - with unprecedented access to British \nand American intelligence agencies across the world and to the \nterrorists themselves, including an exclusive interview with the \nfour Bali bombers.\n\nThis program shows how al Qaeda&amp;#039;s global network was uncovered and \nhow, in response to counterterrorism, that network has evolved new \nstructures and strategies. Through detailed interviews with American\nsecurity officials, European intelligence agents, and alleged\nterrorist organizer Salim Boukhari, the program describes operations\nthat led to the capture of a Frankfurt terrorist cell in 2000.\nThe resilience of terrorist groups is emphasized, with one al Qaeda\nhunter comparing the network to a disease - a virus that quickly\nmutates to avoid destruction. \n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: -2o3- The Hunt For America&amp;#039;s Sleeper Cells (2004...avi\nFile Size....: 350 MB (or 358,460 KB or 367,063,040 bytes)\nFrames.......: 576x336 (1.71:1) [=12:7] @ 0.143 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 691 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8267587593adba2ecb912309c7c22b8679b47e17","amp;dn":"al-Qaeda+-+The+Third+World+War+2o3+%282004-TVRip-d0x%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8267587593adba2ecb912309c7c22b8679b47e17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,103,88,117,147,173,186,46,203,145,35,9,199,194,43,134,121,180,126,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
