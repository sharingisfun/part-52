But the copyright system does not fit well with computer networks, and only draconian punishments can enforce it.\n\nThe global corporations that profit from copyright are lobbying for draconian punishments, and to increase their copyright powers, while suppressing public access to technology. But if we seriously hope to serve the only legitimate purpose of copyright -- to promote progress, for the benefit of the public -- then we must make changes in the other direction.\n\nThis talk by Richard M. Stallman is broken into two parts: the main talk and the question and answer sessions following the talk. Both are available in only Ogg/Theora format in keeping with Stallman&amp;#039;s wishes. They are available under the Creative Commons NoDerivs 1.0 license.&quot;\n\nMore info here: http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/media/Copyright%20vs%20Community%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Computer%20Networks.html\n\n--\n\nThis torrent includes two files encoded in the 3GPP format, suitable for watching in a mobile phone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b1cc32ee692324f126ab8d5da7a09a0f721ba49","amp;dn":"Copyright+vs+Community+in+the+Age+of+Computer+Network+-+Speech+i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b1cc32ee692324f126ab8d5da7a09a0f721ba49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,28,195,46,230,146,50,79,18,106,184,213,218,122,9,160,247,33,186,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
