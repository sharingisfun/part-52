The popular manager of El Caribe, the legendary Russian-owned nightclub in Brooklyn\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Brighton Beach, he has changed his last name and concealed his connection to a long line of distinguished New York cops. For Bobby, every night is a party; he greets friends and customers or dances with his beautiful Puerto Rican girlfriend, Amada, in a haze of cigarette smoke and disco music. But it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s 1988, and New York City\\\\\\&amp;#039;s drug trade is escalating. Bobby tries to keep a friendly distance from the Russian gangster who is operating out of the nightclub--a gangster who is being targeted by his brother, Joseph, an up-and-coming NYPD officer, as well as his father, Burt, the legendary deputy chief of police.\n\nSpoken language(s): Russian, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9aa5f98d2e346d412dcbbbd5ee852113910ad4f","amp;dn":"We+Own+the+Night++%7B2007%2C+DVD9%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9aa5f98d2e346d412dcbbbd5ee852113910ad4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,170,95,152,210,227,70,212,18,220,187,189,94,232,82,17,57,16,173,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
