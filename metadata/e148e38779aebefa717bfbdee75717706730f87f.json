It features small comedy sketches dealing with all of the stages and trials of life. Expect the un-expected. Plenty of religious, vulgar, and sexual humor may offend some groups. There are even musical numbers, but with that same unmistakable brand of Python humor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e148e38779aebefa717bfbdee75717706730f87f","amp;dn":"Monty+Python%5C%27s+The+Meaning+of+Life+2-Disc+%281983%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e148e38779aebefa717bfbdee75717706730f87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,72,227,135,121,174,190,250,113,123,251,222,231,87,23,112,103,48,248,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
