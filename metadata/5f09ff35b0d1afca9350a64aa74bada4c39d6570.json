The goa fans will be certainly\ntouched and bewitched by the diversified oriental tonalities of this dynamic &amp; melodic eastern-influenced album, \nwhich will recreate in your mind a subliminal panoramic vision of the mythic Anatolia. \nPrepare your spirit and mind out your sphere!  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe would like to notice you that this album is also Metapsychic Rec. last release. Our net-label will no longer exist (see the official announcement of our closure\nat our websites), but we are glad and proud to quit this adventure as we started it, with a free goa release that\nyou can consider as a final gift from our part.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAli AlgÃ‚Â³n (Mindsphere) thanks section: \n\nspecial thanks to:\n\nmy wife\nmy family\nand all the turkish psychedelic trance scene who supports me in parties and understands my music.\nspecial thanks to turkish psychedelic trance portal psyturk.com\nA big thanks for Metapsychic label family: Vassilis,oCtodur,Bobby(Aerosis),Astrancer,Lost Buddha(Filipe Santos);Suntrip Records Mars, Anoebis,Filteria and all the people\non the world who loves my spirit.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMetapsychic records would like to thank the following people for their help and support:\n\nWe would like also to express, from the depth of our heart, all our gratitude to our beloved and talented artist, Ali ÃƒÂ´MindsphereÃƒÂ¶, \nfor his amazing album, his trusting and his faithful friendship.
