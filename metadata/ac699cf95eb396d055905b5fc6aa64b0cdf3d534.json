The woman is everything he is not. He is a neat freak who keeps his dishes washed and his books neatly stacked and categorized. She dresses like a slob, smokes pot and never picks anything up. It's a match that somehow works, though. Slowly and entertainingly, more is revealed about the Japanese man and why he's suicidal and living in Bangkok.\n\nDirected by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and starring Japanese superstar Tadanobu Asano (Ichi the Killer, Picnic, Gohatto).
