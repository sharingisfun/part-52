The Soulshake Express, from sweden, starts with the five first songs. The band has been compared with bands like Black Keys, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Wolfmother, Hellacopters among others. Great songs indeed! I love everyone of them. Especially &quot;Woman Like You&quot;!\n\n\nNext up is the norwegian trio Opel. The band has been destined to be the next Gluecifer.
