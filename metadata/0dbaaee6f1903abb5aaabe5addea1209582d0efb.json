IMDB link at the top for more info.\n\nThis includes 5 episodes 4 of them are actual Heathcliff episodes and one of them is an episode featuring Heathcliff's rival Riff-Raff I couldn't find anymore eps with Riff-Raff, I wish there could have been more. And also one episode is from when the series first came out.\n\nAs always check out Nostalgia Tracker old cartoons and more.\n\nhttp://s11.invisionfree.com/nostalgiatracker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dbaaee6f1903abb5aaabe5addea1209582d0efb","amp;dn":"Heathcliff+%5Bnostalgiatracker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dbaaee6f1903abb5aaabe5addea1209582d0efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,186,174,230,241,144,58,187,90,170,190,90,221,234,18,9,88,45,14,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
