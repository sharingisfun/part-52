There&amp;#039;s a castle in the Komonice and according to a legend there is good ghost in the castle - White lady. She emerges from the painting on the wall when someone speaks out magic formula. White lady builds up a water supply for an old woman who asked for that by the painting. Then she makes a new fence and pavement... Not only her acts but even her existence is not suitable for chairman and his secretary but they find something better than forbiden her. They want to make a plan for her which is going to be planned and then checked by local people&amp;#039;s committee and than it would be presented as a work of working class.\n\n\n\t\t\tBila Pani.avi File Details\n\n========================================\n    \nFilesize....................: 694 MB (or 711,576 KB or 728,653,824 bytes)\nFile Type...................: OpenDML AVI\nVideo Codec 4CC.............: xvid\nx:y (aspect ratio)..........: 512x368 (1.39:1) [=32:23]\nVideo Bitrate...............: 866 kb/s\nFPS (frames/sec)............: 25.000\nRuntime.....................: 01:31:14 (136,849 fr)\nAudio Codec.................: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nAudio Bitrate...............: 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR \nFs (sample freq)............: 48000 Hz\nI/L (interleave)............: 1 vid frame (40 ms)  Split: Yes\nIMRR (I/L rate ratio).......: 1.00\nFrame Quality...............: 0.184 bits/pixel\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bb432a083ea7d2d40d1a67d7b41630ed314c424","amp;dn":"Bila+Pani","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bb432a083ea7d2d40d1a67d7b41630ed314c424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,180,50,160,131,234,125,45,64,209,166,125,123,65,99,14,211,20,196,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
