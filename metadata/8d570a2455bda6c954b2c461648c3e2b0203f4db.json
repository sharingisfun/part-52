Murray Abraham\n\n&quot;In 1995, the first gray wolves were transported from Alberta, Canada to Yellowstone National Park, to repopulate the sprawling landscape with the species, absent for more than 70 years. The following year, a second wave of wolves was brought to the park from British Columbia, Canada; five of them were released together, and they were named the Druid Peak pack. Since the arrival of those first immigrants, wolves have thrived in Yellowstone -- and none more dramatically than the Druids. The epic history of the Druids, one of more than a dozen packs now occupying the 2.2 million acres of Yellowstone, is documented in NATURE&amp;#039;s IN THE VALLEY OF THE WOLVES. The program was produced and shot in High Definition by Emmy-award winning filmmaker Bob Landis. On the Web site, you&amp;#039;ll learn how the successful reintroduction of Yellowstone&amp;#039;s apex predator has changed the entire ecosystem of the park, and about the threats that these majestic animals continue to face on their road to recovery.&quot;\n\nmore info: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/wolves/\n\nQuote\n\nFile Size Processed: 5.32 GB, Play Time: 00h:53m:11s\n1920 x 1080, 29.97 fps, 65.00 Mbps (13.70 Mbps Average).\nAverage Video Quality: 55.82 KB/Frame, 0.22 Bits/Pixel.\nAC3 Audio: 2/0 Channels (L, R) (Dolby Surround), 48.0 kHz, 192 kbps.\nDialog Normalization: -23.0 dB\n0 of 95601 video frames found with errors.\n0 of 99729 audio frames found with errors.\n0 corrupted video bytes in file.\n0.000000 seconds of video timestamp gaps.\n0.000000 seconds of audio timestamp gaps. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d570a2455bda6c954b2c461648c3e2b0203f4db","amp;dn":"07.12.17.PBS+Nature+-+In+the+Valley+of+the+Wolves+1080i+AC3+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d570a2455bda6c954b2c461648c3e2b0203f4db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,87,10,36,85,189,166,201,84,178,196,97,100,140,62,43,2,3,244,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
